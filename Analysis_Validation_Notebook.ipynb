This is done with a special algorithm (a neural network) that creates a 'mask' to mark the areas to be blinded (semantic segmentation). A UNET model [1] is used for this purpose, which is trained to accurately recognise areas such as vehicle windscreens. During training, the algorithm itself learns how to mark windscreens. The image is pre-adjusted to a size of 224x224 pixels (configurable) and the brightness is normalised. As a result, the model produces an image in which all vehicle windscreens are marked.After the algorithm is trained and it is applied, the algorithm does not continue to learn. It will then always give the same output at the same input.Notes for experts:* A UNET model with Resnet18 backbone is used.
