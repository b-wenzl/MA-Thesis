Data-driven sewer management at Euvelgunne business park,2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, aiming to control the discharge of sewage in response to climate change-induced heavy showers, particularly at the Euvelgunne business park.",0,"The methods and models are not explained in the entry, but rather, it is mentioned that they are explained in a separate report.",1,"The risks section mentions measures taken to mitigate risks, such as theoretical and practical trials, water quality monitoring, and regular sluice checks, but it does not explicitly describe the nature or context of potential risks or limitations."
Emptying underground waste containers,2,The goal is specific and contextualized with a clear policy objective: to predict when a container needs to be emptied to optimize driver routes and ensure residents can dispose of their waste.,2,"The system's operation is clearly explained, including the input data (number of times a rubbish card is read) and the process (when this number reaches a certain limit, the container is included in a driver's route).",1,"The entry mentions system failures and inspections, but does not specify the nature or context of these risks or limitations."
Scan car,2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, aiming to keep the city liveable and accessible by reducing parking in public spaces and monitoring paid parking using scan cars.",2,"The process is clearly explained, from the use of an electric scanning car with cameras to scan license plates, to the use of an image recognition algorithm to identify license plates, and finally to the comparison with a database of registered parking entitlements.",2,"The risks and limitations are explicitly described, including the decision not to impose fully digitised after-tax assessments, the manual check by a municipal supervisor in case of a negative result, and the privacy considerations related to the license plate recognition system."
Vegetation algorithm (Iteratio 2),2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, aiming to improve the analysis of terrain conditions for nature conservation and restoration using collected data, with clear policy and research objectives.",2,"The logic is clearly explained, detailing the inputs (vegetation recordings), the process (iterative calculations to produce indicator values and average terrain condition values), and the model type (Iteratio computer program).",1,"The limitations are mentioned, acknowledging potential errors in the algorithm, but the nature or context of these errors is not specified."
Search for possible registrations of aliens,2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, stating that the system is used to prevent multiple registrations of foreign nationals in the Dutch government's central information system, the basisvoorziening vreemdelingen.",1,"The system's process is partially explained, mentioning that foreigners' data are registered in the BMS and placed in the phonetic search system, but it does not clearly explain the type of model used or the specific inputs.",1,"The entry mentions that the algorithm is tested annually for correctness, but it does not specify any potential risks, biases, or contexts of inaccuracy."
Reinforcement scenario consideration for homes not meeting safety standard,2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, outlining a clear policy objective to provide residents with a scenario to bring homes that are not up to standard, back to standard.",2,"The logic is clearly explained, with a detailed description of the inputs, process, and model type. It outlines two methods of addressing a sub-standard building and explains the financial equation and scenario determination process.",1,"The entry mentions a risk reduction through human intervention and a built-in ratio, but it does not explicitly describe known risks, data biases, or contexts of inaccuracy."
iCitizenship e-services,2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, outlining the purpose of the e-services and the algorithm to provide support to residents and entrepreneurs in submitting digital applications, and how it improves efficiency and quality of service.",2,"The methods and models section provides a clear explanation of the inputs, process, and model type, detailing how applications are checked against laws and regulations, processed by a civil affairs employee, and in some cases, processed automatically.",1,"The risks section vaguely mentions that it is up to municipalities to shape risk management and configure e-services, but does not specify the nature or context of these risks."
First Aid for Money Matters,2,"The goal is specific and contextualized, aiming to detect early signs of financial problems in residents and offer help to prevent the escalation of debts.",2,"The process is clearly explained, from the input data (supplied by an organization in Excel or CSV), the matching process (based on postcode and house number combinations), to the prioritization and approach (based on number of signals, type of arrears, level of arrears, and available capacity).",1,"The risks are mentioned, such as dependency on the quality and supply of data from partner organizations and adherence to legal retention periods, but the specific nature or context of these risks is not detailed."
