In this technology, several fields of knowledge come together, requiring a multidisciplinary approach to responsibly deal with both the enormous opportunities and risks of this technology. Because of the diverse perspectives, it was decided to explore 6 perspectives in more detail. One perspective is to experiment with generative AI using copilot to support employees in document creation, note-taking and information analysis, among others. The aim is to gain experience with genAI and understand its impact and capabilities in the workplace. Awareness of the risks of AI is also emphasised for responsible use. ","Due to the multidisciplinary nature of AI, the experiment is supervised and driven from a core team consisting of staff with different expertise in diverse fields of knowledge. A limited number of licences will be used so that participants can work with information within the organisation's tennant.The organisation is familiar with SLM Rijk's DPIA and has included it in its risk assessment.

Early detection of debt,Municipality of Almelo,Municipality of Almelo offers help in the fight against poverty. An algorithm in the form of a web application is used for this purpose. The algorithm ensures that a signal about a resident's arrears reaches the municipality. The municipality then offers help.  ,Social Security,,In use,"The algorithm helps the municipality of Almelo fight poverty. With the algorithm, the municipality of Almelo receives signals about payment arrears from housing corporations, health insurers, energy or water companies and private landlords. We try to help residents who are at risk of falling into debt situations as early as possible, thus preventing poverty problems from increasing. When the financial problems are still small, advice can sometimes already be a good solution.","The municipality of Almelo has to deal with laws and regulations under which the municipality of Almelo actively approaches residents with impending debts and offers help. To carry out this statutory task, the algorithm is deployed so that data on arrears reaches the finance coaches at the right time. If employees had to figure this out manually, it would take a lot of time and several people would have access to the sensitive information. Because the algorithm retrieves the data from a system, only signals on arrears (longer than 30 days) reach the municipality without interim inspection by individuals. Good agreements have been made about the exchange of data: it is done in a secure way, only necessary data is shared and the data is not visible to anyone but the municipality's finance coaches. A resident can ultimately choose whether or not to make use of the help provided by the municipality of Almelo.","By amending the Municipal Debt Relief Act (Wgs), early signalling has been a statutory duty for municipalities since 1 January 2021. This law allows designated creditors to report payment arrears. Exchanging this data ensures that signals of debt problems reach the municipality earlier.

If the value 100 is entered here, the number of SDs is thus no longer relevant in the calculation, because by definition, the supplied values of all PDs are used to determine the quoting score. For the quoting requirement, a 3-month rolling average of the average end-month quoting rate is used.For secondary market turnover, the amounts traded by each Primary Dealer in the secondary market with a selection of counterparty types are considered. Both buy and sell trades count. The ranking is done on a 2-month rolling average of turnover.A percentage is attached to the quoting ranking. Currently, the percentage ranges from 21% (ranking 1) to 9% (ranking 13). This percentage is applied to the respective dealer's offtake during the auction to calculate the non-competitive. ","No automated decision-making takes place. The calculation of the non-competitive is done manually in Excel, but is based on fixed formulas set out in the policy. The variable input, offtake during auctions, is entered manually in Excel.  ","A technical risk is the miscalculation of the non-competitive option, which could theoretically give Primary Dealers an additional financial benefit. Based on this technical risk, it can also become a financial risk for the Agency.

Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight.From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to fit.","If the algorithm cannot find an appropriate category based on the text written by the notifier, the notification is put on the ""other"" category by the algorithm. A human assessment then takes place and the notification is still assigned to an appropriate category.","There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category.

If no additional data is required from the resident and no manual actions or checks by the municipality are required (such as signature, for example) to process the application, it can be processed without the intervention of a civic affairs officer. However, if additional data, checks or actions are required, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There, it is checked by a civil affairs employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve an application/declaration. Only the civil affairs officer can reject an application/declaration.The impact is that such an application can be dealt with efficiently by the municipality; after all, a resident/company has already carried out several steps (work), leaving the official more time for the special and/or complicated declarations/applications the municipality receives. In some cases, this application can even be processed fully automatically. The quality of service goes up because of these services, as does the quality of the data in the BRP.","Handling all applications through the counter is no longer an option for municipalities.

With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm.

There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk.

Blurring as a Service,Municipality of Amsterdam,Blurring as a Service (BaaS) is a generic service that allows anonymising images from public space by removing people and license plates.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"Blurring as a Service (BaaS) is a generic service that allows anonymising images from public space by removing people and license plates. The service can be used for different data sources and is first deployed for panoramic images.Since 2016, panorama images of the entire city have been collected annually by the Basic Information Department (Mobile Mapping team) to visualise the City of Amsterdam. Among other things, the panorama images allow municipal employees to inspect public space from their workplaces for various purposes, such as accessibility with special vehicles or inspection of roads. It is similar to how Google Streetview works, although this should provide a more up-to-date view of the city. For these tasks, it is not necessary to visualise or keep recognisable persons or license plates. It was therefore decided that these images should be anonymised. The anonymisation algorithm has been developed for this purpose. The deployment of the algorithm can be considered a measure to process the data carefully and lawfully. The developed facility 'Blurring as a Service' can prevent images with recognisable people and license plates from being used for municipal work processes.The Computer Vision Team developed the facility that allows panoramic images to be anonymised. The algorithm is trained to recognise entire persons, not just faces, and license plates on (panorama) images. This ensures that these persons and license plates are then 'blurred', effectively anonymising them.","
It is conceivable that certain groups could be better or less well recognised by the algorithm. This could then result in different treatment or a distinction based on external characteristics, for example on the basis of gender, age, skin colour and related clothing and attributes (e.g. Disability, profession or hobby). The adverse consequence is that certain groups are more likely to be (temporarily) recognisably included in Amsterdam municipality systems. This should obviously be avoided. 

The algorithm was trained on a balanced dataset, i.e., ensuring that as many groups as possible are represented. For example, images were selected around schools and also in neighbourhoods where more people with a non-Western migration background live in order to adequately represent children and people with different skin colours in the dataset.

There is an obligation on the municipality to investigate whether such a disparity exists. This investigation has now been carried out and the results can be accessed via: Link to public page.
",,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Architecture of the model:
The model is YOLOv5, a convolutional neural network that can be used for object detection. The network receives an image and predicts the locations of people and number plates on the images with so-called bounding boxes, aka squares. Subsequently, these areas are blurred by blurring the pixels.

Performance:
The anonymisation algorithm currently has an accuracy of roughly 95% for people close to the camera.
For number plates close to the camera, it anonymises about 97%.
The algorithm is tuned to prefer to anonymise slightly too much rather than too little. So it might find that a scooter, tree or other object is also blurred. We would rather blur a little too much than too little.
Through visual inspection on a sample, we found that the persons who are not recognised are usually not recognisable because they are, for example, partially behind a tree. Ideally, of course, these persons would also be anonymised, unfortunately this is not yet possible.","Processing basis:The reason and need to develop an anonymisation algorithm is based on the municipality's task to keep the core register up to date and reliable. This is based on Article 2(2) of the Large-Scale Topography Key Register Act, and Article 2(1) of the Addresses and Buildings Key Register Act and Article 6(1)(e) of the AVG. In addition, the following is included in the relevant Regulation (Basic Information Regulations 2018:A. The public task as source supplier for the core register of panoramic images (article 7); B. The public task as source holder. The process of anonymisation is a further processing of the acquired panorama images. That process can be considered compatible with the original purposes according to the WP29, provided the anonymisation process aims to reliably produce anonymised information and provided there is a basis for the primary use. See Article 29 Working Party, 'Opinion 5/2014 on anonymisation techniques', WP 216, p. 8: Given the performance of the algorithm, it can be said to be a reliable way of anonymising information. This performance has now been independently tested by an external party, Verdonck, Klooster &amp; Associates. The performance values have also been determined by the CIO. It can be concluded that this constitutes permissible compatible further processing.

Personal data:Face and posture of people in public spaces;Face and posture of people who are in a residential object or office, or who are behind windows. Panoramic images are only taken outdoors. License plates;Company details, e.g. on company vehicles, signs or premises.Training:The images collected over the past few years have been used as training data to develop the algorithm. These are roughly 10,000 raw images. These images were needed to manually train the algorithm to learn to recognise people and license plates. The aim is for the algorithm to learn to be able to remove the persons and license plates on new images. This process is called 'annotation' and 'training'.  This training set for the algorithm is stored in the City of Amsterdam's Azure cloud environment. The training set is kept as long as the algorithm is in use to possibly make future improvements. The panorama images are stored in an encrypted environment and only officials who need the images can access them, e.g. the algorithm's developers.Testing:Some of the data is captured, kept separate to then test the algorithm with. So the training and testing data virtually overlap, although they are different images. Roughly 1,000 number of images were used for testing. Operating:The algorithm is currently being used for the following application:Acquiring panoramic images twice a year for the purpose of keeping core records current and reliable. This involves a large quantity of images;In the short term, the algorithm is expected to be used to anonymise images on which potentially illegally placed (heavy) containers have been spotted on vulnerable quay walls and bridges. This involves about 2,000 images per year. The number of applications may increase in the future. ","
There is no automated decision-making by using the algorithm. A citizen or entrepreneur will never receive a decision or order generated by this algorithm. 
Users of the algorithm, after sending images to the Computer Vision Team, will receive back anonymised images. These images will be able to become part of a case, for example in the context of Supervision and Enforcement. The case handler can always judge for himself whether an image is sufficiently anonymised. 
A number of processes are in place to counteract errors.1. When processing a batch of images, a sample is taken and checked manually. This aims to verify that the algorithm does what is expected;
2. A feedback process is put in place so that errors can be corrected. In addition, these errors can also be used to improve the algorithm;
3. An annual evaluation takes place to determine whether the algorithm needs to be improved.

A dangerous traffic situation or nuisance from people and catering establishments can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report fitted best (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality. But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, people did not always choose the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. On this basis, it determines which category the report best fits and which team should handle it. So the caller no longer has to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right team.",,,1.0,,gemeente@woensdrecht.nl,nld,,"Notification texts are used for the algorithm. While making a report, the reporter can choose to leave a phone number or e-mail address on a new page, but this information is only used for providing feedback on status changes. This information is not kept longer than necessary for this purpose, nor is it used for the algorithm.","The text of the notification is broken down into individual words. Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, set against the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight.From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which team within the municipality the report is most likely to fit.",All calls that are categorised with less than 40% certainty are forwarded to the Customer Contact Centre (CCC). A human assessment then takes place and the call is still categorised. Reports that are wrongly forwarded to an incorrect category are also manually placed in the correct category by the KCC staff.,"There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the right team faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. KCC staff review those calls and manually put them in the right category. If the algorithm does not work properly, it therefore takes a little longer for the report to reach the right team. The reporter can add personal data if he or she wants to be kept informed.

Signal model OB Carousel Fraud (OBCF),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,This page contains information about the 'OB Carousel Fraud' algorithm. This algorithm helps the Inland Revenue find possible carousel fraud. ,Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"Most businesses file sales tax (also known as VAT) returns. Sales tax returns are filed for a certain period of time, monthly, quarterly or annually. In some cases, the return is not filed, or is filed incorrectly in order to pay less tax or wrongly claim tax back. In such cases, fraud may be involved. A well-known form of VAT fraud is carousel fraud. In carousel fraud, a trader does not pay VAT to the Tax Authorities, while this trader charges this VAT to his customers. The fraud crosses several EU countries via a complex multi-company supply chain. At least one company does not remit the VAT received. Because the fraud is so complexly set up, the tax authorities and well-intentioned traders are misled. The entrepreneur keeps the VAT received for himself, thus disadvantaging the government and society. Because the goods or services are often traded in a circle, this is called carousel fraud.The Tax and Customs Administration wants to spot possible carousel fraud as early as possible so that timely action can be taken to prevent damage. To this end, the OBCF algorithm, among others, is used. The results of the algorithm are used by experienced staff as an aid to assess whether carousel fraud may be involved. Incidentally, as in the above, the abuse does not always take place in a circle. Using the algorithm, other forms of Intra-Community VAT fraud can also be detected.","Using the deployment of the OBCF algorithm, experienced staff can detect possible carousel networks at the earliest possible stage. This allows fraud to be prevented or mitigated as early as possible. OBCF assigns a score to companies based on certain data known to indicate an increased likelihood of possible involvement in carousel fraud. This allows the officer to conduct quicker and more targeted investigations and to spot possible carousel fraud more quickly.

Turnover tax Absenteeism Prevention and Attendance (OMV),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,The algorithms OBVP and OBVA support Inland Revenue employees in combating sales tax return omissions. OBVP focuses on preventing failure to file or late filing of returns. OBVA deals with entrepreneurs who have not filed a return when they were obliged to do so.  ,Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"'Sales tax absenteeism prevention (OBVP)' and 'Sales tax absenteeism approach (OBVA)' Most businesses file sales tax (also known as VAT) returns. Sales tax returns are filed for a specific period of time, monthly, quarterly or annually. If the return is not filed on time, it is a declaration default. The OBVP algorithm uses a number of indicators to estimate the probability that the return will not be filed. In case of a high probability of default, a company is called by an employee. Attention is then drawn to the obligation to file a return and, if necessary, they are explained how to file a return.The algorithm OBVA periodically makes an overview of the declaration absenteeism. It distinguishes between different groups. Starters who miss their first return are treated differently from entrepreneurs who have failed to file a return three times or more. Starters are called to explain how to file their returns. In case of repeated omissions, depending on the situation, the company will receive a letter with the intention of withdrawing the OB number. No new returns are then issued, which prevents future retrospective assessments and fines. ","Both algorithms help proactively address sales tax return defaults. With OBVP, companies can be called before the tax return deadline to prevent absenteeism. To do so, the algorithm looks at past patterns to predict which companies might not file their returns on time. OBVA makes it possible to target each group appropriately.

Signal model office test OB (OBN),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,This page contains information about the 'OB Negative' algorithm. This algorithm supports the tax inspector in determining which turnover tax returns with a negative balance (a tax refund within the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) target group) should be assessed manually.,Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"Most businesses file sales tax (also known as VAT) returns. A negative sales tax return means that a business has paid more VAT in the return period than it received and therefore requests a refund from the tax authorities. This may be the case, for example, in the case of high investments or low turnover in that period. The Tax and Customs Administration receives some 2.6 million negative returns every year. Some of these negative returns are assessed manually. This means that an employee checks whether the return has been filled in correctly on the basis of supporting documents. If this reveals inaccuracies, a correction is made. What is the algorithm used for?Not all negative declarations can be assessed manually. The number is too large for that. Also, the Tax and Customs Administration does not want to burden entrepreneurs unnecessarily with providing supporting documents. That is why the manual assessment focuses mainly on the declarations that are estimated in advance to have a higher chance of being incorrect. The algorithm OB-negative is used to detect these potentially incorrect SME returns. Based on the results of the algorithm, the returns are selected for manual assessment. ","By using OB-negative, potentially incorrect returns can be better spotted. The algorithm makes optimal use of the relevant data, such as the amounts entered in the return.

Road use control (MRB),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,This page contains information about the algorithm 'Checking road use'. This algorithm helps employees of the Inland Revenue enforce Motor Vehicle Tax (MRB) and Heavy Motor Vehicle Tax (BZM).,Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"The algorithm is part of enforcement, specifically supervision, of Motor Vehicle Tax (MRB) and Heavy Motor Vehicle Tax (BZM). The purpose of the algorithm is the automated (pre)selection at for monitoring the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of the MRB and BZM registration/declaration.For the MRB, checks are carried out on motor vehicles under the dealer scheme and driving without dealer registration plates. It also checks for suspended motor vehicles. These motor vehicles are not allowed to be or drive on public roads. For BZM, a check is made on whether the BZM due for heavy trucks has been paid. Trucks (or vehicle combinations) intended for goods transport with a maximum authorised mass of more than 12,000 kg (empty weight + maximum load capacity) are obliged to pay BZM when using the motorway. An exemption may apply in certain cases. The algorithm reviews a large amount of camera footage and data from the tax authorities on a daily basis to determine whether there may be an offence. It is an offence under the MRB Act if a motor vehicle is driving on public roads while its registration plate is suspended, or without a trader's registration plate if the motor vehicle is under trader's scheme. Similarly, if a heavy truck has not paid the Excise Duty due while using the motorway, the taxpayer is also violating the Excise Duty Act. When a possible violation is observed, this observation is sent to the Inland Revenue. The clerk then checks these observations for accuracy. Based on the clerk's assessment, it is decided whether the observations are forwarded to the assessment process.Taxpayers eligible for a possible additional assessment/fine decision first receive a preliminary notice, followed by the additional assessment/fine decision itself. In case of violation, the suspension of the relevant registration number is terminated, after which the motor vehicle is included in the regular MRB levy process. This means that the holder of the relevant motor vehicle has to pay the MRB due. Holders of trucks who have not paid the BZM due will also first receive an advance notice possibly followed by a post-tax assessment/fine decision. So that they still pay the BZM for using the motorway.","The mass surveillance process is important for compliance with Motor Vehicle Tax Act and Heavy Motor Vehicle Tax Act. We want to do this carefully. The algorithm can support a Tax Administration employee in this process. As a result, the assessment is more careful, efficient and uniform.

In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,info@vrzw.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor. If it turns out that the algorithm is making incorrect classifications more often, this is picked up by the monitoring so that adjustments to the algorithm can be made.

Anonymise,Municipality of Dijk en Waard,"The algorithm underlines personal data in documents. An employee has to review all pages and check whether the document is properly anonymised. Then the software removes all highlighted information and blacklists it. After that, the documents can be published, for example under the Open Government Act (WOO).",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation software is used to anonymise documents published by the municipality faster and better. In this way, we prevent data leaks and contribute to better protection of data subjects' AVG rights.","The municipality increasingly has to disclose information. Therefore, privacy- or business-sensitive information has to be lacquered out. Before the algorithm was deployed, this deleting did not always go well. There were data breaches where not all personal data was deleted or where deleted information could still be read. The advantage of anonymisation software is that anonymisation is faster and better. The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server. The content is not stored on this server, so the privacy risk of using the algorithm does not outweigh the privacy benefit of reducing the number of data breaches due to improper anonymisation. ",1. WOO 2. WCO 3. UAVG 4. WEP 5. WDO,1.0,,https://www.dijkenwaard.nl/,nld,,"All information found in the uploaded documents (except metadata) is processed by the algorithm. This may include ordinary personal data, special personal data and criminal data. It may also include business-sensitive information.","Documents are uploaded to the application by an employee. At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8. Minimum key figures for the accuracy of identifying personal data are as follows: Named entities (precision): 0.78, Named entities (recall): 0.76, Named entities (F-score): 0.77. Finally, a staff member checks the document and when it completes the document, the data to be anonymised is permanently removed from the text layer and a black bar is placed.",The outcome of the algorithm is checked by an employee. The clerk is required by the software to check all pages. The clerk determines whether the document is correctly anonymised.,"There is no risk of automated decision-making and the algorithm has no impact on fundamental rights because the algorithm does not make decisions with legal consequences. It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists. The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified. The risks do not outweigh the privacy benefits and the risk of poor anonymisation by not using this software.",Xxllnc,,,,,,,Other algorithms,"1: Woo, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754/. 2: WDO, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/NL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046. 3: UAVG, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 4: Wep, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961. 5: Wdo, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0048156",1: DEDA anonimiseringssoftware. 2: DPIA anonimiseringssoftware,,48783532
AERIUS - Computing tool for the living environment,Province of Limburg,"Aerius is a publicly accessible ICT tool used since 2015 to support zoning (nitrogen calculations) under what is now the Environment Act, nature section. ",Nature and Environment,https://limburg.nl/bestuur/open-overheid/algoritmeregister,In use,"The AERIUS tool consists of several modules. AERIUS Calculator is the 'calculator' with which the nitrogen deposition contribution of a plan or project can be made transparent, AERIUS Monitor provides information about the total nitrogen load on protected nature areas and the origin of this deposition, AERIUS Register enables competent authorities to allocate nitrogen deposition space to new permits via nitrogen banks, and AERIUS Check serves to support subsidy schemes, such as the peak load approach.When consent is granted, AERIUS Calculator serves as a starting point to determine whether a plan or project may have a significant impact on nitrogen-sensitive habitats in Natura 2000 areas. The calculation results from AERIUS Calculator are included in the further assessment of the effects in the granting of permission.AERIUS Monitor shows the figures calculated by RIVM on total deposition and exceedance of the KDW. This monitoring information is used to draw up new policy or adjust existing policy. The figures provide insight into the effort required and tools for specifying, for example, sectors or locations.","AERIUS Calculator is designed to make the complexity of dispersion modelling accessible to a wide audience. The tool provides a low-threshold interface in which a user can enter an activity itself. To perform the calculation, AERIUS Calculator calls underlying data and calculation models. These models are Standard Calculation Method 2 (SRM-2) for short-range road traffic and the Operational Priority Substances Model (OPS) for all other emission sources. These scientific models are managed and continuously developed by RIVM for use in AERIUS, among others. The models are also used in other dossiers, such as air quality.Using calculation models to determine nitrogen deposition as a result of a plan or project is necessary because the effect of future activities cannot be measured. To approach reality as closely as possible with the model calculation, the most up-to-date scientific knowledge is used in the calculation models. AERIUS is updated annually to incorporate, among other things, model developments.

It mainly concerns environmental data.,"AERIUS uses:1) the Operational Priority Substances dispersion model (OPS-long term) for the calculation of airborne concentrations and nitrogen deposition on the Earth's surface, 2) Standard Calculation Method 2 (SRM2) for the dispersion of short-range traffic emissions.These models are described separately in the respective model descriptions.","Anyone can make a calculation in AERIUS Calculator. To do so, the user needs to create and define emission sources himself. As soon as a calculation is started by the user, AERIUS calculates the nitrogen deposition as a result of the emission sources entered by the user.The results of the AERIUS calculation can then be used in the further assessment surrounding consent. Whether permission can actually be granted is determined by the relevant competent authority.","The management of AERIUS explicitly addresses risk management.

These are areas where you are not allowed to drive certain cars and other vehicles for various reasons. This is arranged this way because the Municipality of Rotterdam wants to improve the air quality and liveability in Rotterdam. The Municipality also wants to encourage people to use clean and sustainable modes of transport more often. IMPACT: If the camera detects a car entering a closed area, a photo is taken. Based on a photo of a license plate, enriched with RDW data and any exemptions, a computer programme checks whether a vehicle has access to a particular closed area. If this is not the case, this photo and its information are assessed by an authorised officer. The consequences for citizens may be that a fine is imposed unfairly. However, this is overcome by the assessment of a boa. The use of cameras may make citizens feel that they are being recorded everywhere. Due to the algorithm application, only license plates are captured, persons are blurred.","To achieve the goal of closed-circuit areas, as many people as possible must obey the rules. This means the highest possible chance of catching offenders during all times of the day. That is why the control is carried out with cameras hanging in the same place and license plates are checked automatically. Other ways to achieve this goal have also been sought.

Based on this enriched message, an analysis is performed as to whether the vehicle is allowed in the area and if not and if applicable, whether an exemption has been granted to that specific vehicle. This information is used to determine whether the particular vehicle was lawfully allowed to enter that particular area. If it is determined that the particular vehicle was not allowed to enter the area, the enforcement process follows.In the enforcement process, a visual check follows: the accuracy of the violations found and the completeness of the corresponding information is checked daily by boas. The boa then decides whether vehicle is in violation. Only after approval, the offences are forwarded to the administration of enforcement, which collects the necessary data of the offence and then forwards it to CJIB (Central Judicial Collection Agency).

TVL Risk model,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,"The algorithm is used to make an automated risk assessment for all Applications for Fixed Chargesgemoetkoming, prior to automated or manual granting and payment of the advance. ","Economy, Social Security",,Out of use,"With the deployment of the algorithm, decision making is accelerated so that as many entrepreneurs as possible can receive liquidity support on time. The algorithm speeds up decision-making for granting relief and it provides risk interpretation for manual flow.  ","In the TVL, the risk model (algorithm) is used to automatically check all applications against the scheme criteria and make a risk classification on improper use. Prior to the advance payment and before the final determination of the grant. This speeds up the decision-making chain so that entrepreneurs can receive liquidity support as soon as possible. 
The deployment of the risk model enables RFO to make positive decisions on large numbers of subsidy applications in a very short time, so that entrepreneurs who need fixed expense support quickly during corona lockdowns can get it. Furthermore, the risk model enables RFO to process only positive decisions without the intervention of an employee, allowing employees to assess the remaining decisions more quickly. A similar outcome without the deployment of the risk model was assessed as not feasible during the preparation of the scheme: it would require a large-scale scaling-up of specialised staff, which cannot be organised at short notice. Even if it had succeeded, the turnaround times for entrepreneurs would have been much longer without the risk model. ","The House of Representatives was informed about the largely automated implementation through the following progress report, see: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2021/03/22/voortgangsrapportage-tvl",1.0,,"Voor contact over deze registratie neem contact op met RVO via het contactformulier; https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/over-ons/contact/formulier onder vermelding van Bedrijf/instelling,  Covid-19: TVL/TOGS/ATE, of Overheidsorganisatie, Covid-19 regelingen.",nld,,,,"With each new TVL round (application phase as well as determination phase), the risk model is adjusted and resubmitted for approval to an interdepartmental advisory committee (rolling review), which advises the general director of RFO on the application of the risk model. Once it has been put into use, the risk model determines the qualitative and quantitative risk of each application; these factors together form the overall risk category. Category 1 is awarded automatically, from Category 2 10% falls out to manual and the rest is awarded automatically. In case the algorithm identifies an application as high risk, Category 3, it falls out to a manual check by an employee. For example, because the amount is high, the application is incomplete, or there are indications of abuse or improper use. The application is then readied for human review, and the algorithm gives advice to the clerk on what to look out for, such as data that is incomplete or contradictory. This can be useful: the advice helps the clerk to get a quick picture of the situation. The clerk then reviews the entire application. The clerk can then approve or reject applications, possibly after a further request for information. A negative decision (no grant or lower grant) therefore does not follow from the risk model but always from an employee's assessment.

The algorithm determines whether there is entitlement and how high the allowance will be. Throughout the year, an advance payment is given. After the end of the year, based on income, assets and landlord data, the allowance is finally calculated. If the algorithm fails to perform the assessment automatically, the algorithm may ask for help from an official.","The advantage of using an algorithm:Efficiency and speed: the algorithm works automatically. This allows the Benefits Department to efficiently process millions of rent allowance applications quickly;Consistency: the algorithm provides an approach that is always the same which reduces the risk of errors and/or discrepancies;Traceability: by using the algorithm, the allowance calculation is automatically recorded, making it easier to track and control the decision process.An official will manually review the application in case of missing data, technical errors or as part of an audit.",The legal basis for the use and collection of data is regulated by the General Income Support Act (Awir) and the Housing Benefit Act. For more information see https://wetten.overheid.nl,1.0,,algoritmeregister.toeslagen@toeslagen.nl,nld,,The use of data is tested against the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The following data are required when applying for and calculating rent allowance:the applicant's personal data;the personal details of any partner and other resident(s) registered at the address (these are part of the household for the purposes of the rent allowance); the rent;the service costs;(special) housing type;the (estimated) income and assets per household member.,"The Rent Benefit Act stipulates that citizens can apply for and change rent benefit if there is reason to do so. The algorithm calculates the right and amount of the rent allowance based on the supplied data and the Awir. Once all final income and asset data are collected, a final settlement is made and shared with citizens.  In addition, reasonableness checks are applied to protect both citizens and the executor from unintentional errors and their possible consequences.  In some situations, the application cannot be assessed automatically. Then an official does the processing of the application manually (see human intervention).","An official will manually review the application if there are missing data, technical errors or selected supervision by an official. If necessary, the applicant and/or co-occupant will be contacted to get the missing data. This new data is again given to the algorithm so that the algorithm can complete the assessment automatically. If necessary, an official can also calculate and check the rent allowance manually.","Risk management and safeguardsFor algorithm development, the Surcharge Service has created conditions: a quality framework. This contains rules and agreements that are followed when developing the algorithm. The conditions come from the National Audit Office and are guiding. The algorithm has determined the business rules through laws and regulations. These business rules are constantly tested and maintained so that we remain compliant with laws and regulations and political wishes. If something changes in an algorithm, Dienst Toeslagen checks whether it still meets the quality requirements. Equality, non-discrimination and privacyWhen using data, Dienst Toeslagen complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG). The AVG prescribes that no more data may be used than necessary. This is called data minimisation. The Benefits Agency regularly examines whether the data used are still necessary and may therefore be used. If this is not the case, the algorithm is adjusted and data are also no longer used.ProfilingThe algorithm only uses data listed under the data heading.

But this technology also has downsides: training AI takes a lot of energy and natural resources, owners of the source material for training the models are not paid, and the model - depending on the sources - can produce racist or other ethically undesirable results.  Apart from these general criticisms, there are also risks to the organisation. Documents offered to a chatbot can be used by the supplier to further train the model. What if they contain sensitive information? Or if an official consults the bot to find information to support decision-making, while the model answers based on dated or outright incorrect information? Research is needed to explore the value of Generative AI for Amsterdam while identifying practical risks. Amsterdam employees will therefore start using an internal Generative AI chatbot for a limited period of time: ChatAmsterdam. This chatbot is built with Open AI's GPT4.0 language model and is not otherwise modified or supplemented with (internal) training data.   During the research period, usage behaviour, value and risks will be assessed to determine whether we will use this technology in the future. ","We know that Generative AI is already being used by employees AND we recognise the opportunities and risks. There are plenty of applications to consider for the organisation: both internal and external. But before we allow Generative AI (within the compliancy requirements) within the Municipality of Amsterdam, research is needed. How do people communicate with a bot? What kind of (sensitive) information is sent along in the prompts? What are the results used for?How valuable is the technology for the Amsterdam municipality and the city's citizens and entrepreneurs?

",ChatAmsterdam as a Generative AI chatbot uses the GPT4.0 language model in its current form without adding any (internal) training data or other data. It is the same language model that ChatGPT uses.   ChatAmsterdam works in a similar way to ChatGPT. Employees can ask a question or issue a command (called a prompt) to the chat application and then receive a generated response. An example of this is summarising or rewriting texts.   The language model processes the entered question or command and included information and then sends the generated answer back to the user. ,"The chatbot and underlying language model do not make independent decisions, nor are they part of an automatic decision-making process without human intervention.   All generated answers are viewed by the user who asked the question/command to the chatbot.

In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,gemeente@woensdrecht.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor.

Octobox Anonymisation,Advisory Committee on Public Access and Information Management (ACOI),"The algorithm in the software is mainly set to recognise and anonymise privacy-sensitive information in documents. Basis for this is the AVG. The tool is also used to highlight and mask information that cannot be shared for other reasons (based on another basis, e.g. the Woo) in a document. ",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation tool is used to give substance to transparency on the one hand and the necessary protection of the individuals, companies and institutions to whom documents relate on the other.Transparency because it enables the organisation to share information according to regulations such as the Woo, either actively or passively. For citizens about whom there is data in documents to be published, the use means that there is no privacy violation and the organisation thus complies with the AVG. The same applies to the protection of privacy data of the organisation's employees.The applicant of a Woo request receives the information she asked for, either in anonymised version or partially masked on a different basis. For the departments within the organisation responsible for handling a Woo request and/or publishing information, it means complying with laws and regulations. Use of the software reduces turnaround time and therefore contributes to being able to provide requested information within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low. This applies to individuals (citizens, employees of buying organisations) and companies and institutions. The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and masks or indicates them regardless of the further content of documents. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to a subject person, there are no automatic decisions. In addition, the tool has the option of manually masking information that cannot be made public for other reasons. With this, for example, a text fragment containing strategic information can be marked to protect one's own organisation or a partner organisation (government, company or institution). The basis for anonymising or masking is indicated in the box.","It happens that text excerpts in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo has provided Foundations on the basis of which that is possible. And the AVG is also such a basis for non-Woo publications. Without the use of the software, anonymising text fragments in documents would take significantly more time.

There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk.

Information-driven enforcement:
Four algorithms are being developed within the Digital Moat for information-driven enforcement. So far, fairway inspectors have not imposed sanctions based on these algorithms. The algorithms are not yet in use because they must first be assessed for legal and municipal requirements and applicability. A detailed description will be added to the register when the algorithms are put into use.
Reporting passenger shipping speeding: A speed limit applies on Amsterdam's inland waterways to prevent unsafe situations and nuisance. Exceeding the speed limit causes unsafe situations and nuisance, especially due to wave action. The algorithm uses AIS data from passenger vessels to measure speed violations. The model works with a calculation rule that determines whether a vessel is travelling faster than the applicable speed limit (plus uncertainty margin) at least two consecutive times. The model is under development and not in use. The algorithm is applied to create a heatmap. In other words, providing an overview of the spatial distribution of speeding and highlighting specific vessels. The reporting is intended to make monitoring and enforcement more efficient and may lead to calling shipping companies to account for observed violations. No automated decision-making is used.","
The Digital Canal:
The Digital Canal measures traffic on Amsterdam's inland waterways. The project started in 2019 under the Sailing programme. The Sailing programme falls within the Space and Economy cluster. For the project, sensors have been placed along the inland waterways in the city centre and the main waterways outside the centre of Amsterdam. By deploying these sensors, the municipality is developing a dynamic traffic model and tools for information-driven enforcement. This is done with the help of algorithms. The calculated traffic data is processed and presented in a digital overview (dashboard). The dashboard is accessible to policy advisers, nautical managers and waterway inspectors. 
Six algorithms are used within the Digital Moat: two for traffic monitoring (Pressure per channel and waterway traffic model) and four for information-driven enforcement (Detection of illegal passenger shipping, Reporting speeding passenger shipping, Detection of noise nuisance on the water and Reporting mooring use passenger shipping). Now, the algorithm Reporting Passenger Speed Exceedances is described.

- Avoiding and controlling unsafe situations (safety);
- Good pedestrian accessibility of public functions and good traffic flow in a wider area around busy locations (accessibility and flow);
- A high-quality public space in which pedestrians feel welcome, safe and comfortable (quality and comfort).","Deploying cameras with algorithms is the only way to effectively achieve the goal, as it allows monitoring pedestrian and bicycle traffic in a large area from 1 location. ","The municipality of Amsterdam carries out Slow Traffic Monitoring in public spaces under Article 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 (Wvw 1994). The municipality of Amsterdam is road manager. In this role, it is responsible for ensuring the safe and smooth flow of traffic as well as keeping public functions accessible. This also applies to slow traffic and pedestrian flows. 

The municipality processes these data for the performance of a task of general interest, namely promoting a safe, accessible and comfortable public space.",1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Census data from the Langzaam Verkeer Monitoringsysteem Amsterdam (LVMA) provides information from public spaces on numbers of passers-by. Slow traffic is mainly pedestrians and cyclists. This information is used strategically, tactically and operationally to support traffic management.

On the sensor, images are translated into counting data. - Numbers per direction - Speed - Density in measuring section - Modality The various calculation rules on the near real-time counting data then take care of this data processing, including: - Storing - Aggregating (summarising over a longer period of time) - Enrichment and calculations on the count data - Short-term prediction - Limit values - Dashboard - Making count data publicly available Short-term prediction Aggregated count data from the past 8 weeks From the same quarter of an hour on the day -&gt; what has been the increase/decrease in the number of passers-by at the same time Development current day The City of Amsterdam does not store any personal data in the LVMA.

Think of DVM-exchange as controlling information and matrix signs about congestion. 2) by human intervention, a decision to take traffic measures. In this case, the algorithm provides part of the information for that decision. 
 
Regular validations are performed that compare numbers from the measurement systems with the actual numbers on the street. ","If numbers are under/overestimated along a sensor, spikes/decreases in numbers in the database and dashboard can occur. This can give the crowd manager a distorted picture of the actual situation. 
The system is decision-supportive in operations; this means that visual checks are always made on location before a measure (e.g. setting one-way traffic) is deployed. 

Location data /Combining datasets: At very low numbers along sensors and when combined with other datasets, it could theoretically be possible that a trajectory of a passer-by could be tracked along several sensors.

This allows the municipality to better facilitate demonstrations while observing public order. ,"We in Amsterdam get many notifications for demonstrations every year (1656 in 2023, over 2000 in 2024 until September). These come in via a notification form. Demonstrating is a fundamental right. To protect this right, the municipality, police and prosecutor's office are actively committed. From the input of the notifications, we look at what is needed to do this. And in response to police information, we evaluate the course of demonstrations.

For example, to gain insight into the number of demonstrations spread over time (per year and month) and locations (where are the most demonstrations). All personal data may apply. The organiser who registers the demonstration with the municipality is free to fill in the field containing information about the demonstration or the organiser of the demonstration.

Data visualisation at OOV does not provide an automated advice or solution. ","Demonstrating is a fundamental right. People are free to demonstrate for any purpose. It may happen that the organiser of a demonstration demonstrates to draw attention to issues linked to religion, gender, political views, etc. The law does not allow the mayor to interfere with the content of a demonstration.

",Public Order and Safety,,In use,"If something needs to be fixed or cleaned up on the street or in a park, it can be reported to the municipality through SIA, the online reporting system. A dangerous traffic situation or nuisance from people and catering establishments can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report fit best (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality. But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, people did not always choose the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. Based on this, it determines which category the report best fits and which department should handle it. So the caller no longer needs to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right department.",,,1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"The dataset consists of reports made previously (free text field). Initially, we used 300,000 notifications from past years to train the algorithm. It is regularly retrained with new reports and implemented corrections to existing reports. If the Action Service Centre or departments see an incorrect categorisation, (see Human Monitoring) they correct it manually in the notification system. These corrections are used in re-training. We are investigating whether retraining the algorithm can be automated in the future. We cannot disclose this dataset in this register. Because the data comes from a free text field, it may contain personal data, although this is explicitly not requested.

For other information on processing personal data, see: https://www.amsterdam.nl/privacy/specifieke/privacyverklaringen-wonen/meldingen-overlast-privacy","The text of the notification is broken down into individual words. Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, set against the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight. From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to fit.This algorithm can very accurately detect in which category a combination of words belongs; the algorithm has a score of 0.88 (macro-weighted F1 score). Other methods have also been tried (W2V, CNN+LSTM, BERT) but were found to perform less well.

A human assessment then takes place and the report is still categorised. Reports that are wrongly forwarded to an incorrect category are also manually placed in the correct category by the responsible department (sometimes via the Action Service Centre).,"There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. Staff at the Action Service Centre review those reports and manually put them in the right category. If the algorithm does not work properly, it therefore takes a little longer for the report to reach the right department. The reporter can add personal data if he or she wants to be kept informed.

Researchworthiness: Smart check livelihood,Municipality of Amsterdam,Investigability Algorithm 'Smart check'. A tool that helps staff determine whether a life support application is research-worthy.,Social Security,,Out of use,"The municipality of Amsterdam issues welfare benefits to Amsterdam residents who are entitled to them. Not everyone who applies for welfare benefits qualifies for them. That is why we investigate assistance applications that may be unlawful. The municipality of Amsterdam wants to prevent Amsterdammers from receiving unjustified assistance, accumulating debts and getting into trouble.Even Amsterdam residents who are entitled to social assistance are sometimes investigated by an employee of Work and Income Enforcement. We want to prevent this as much as possible, because such investigations can be annoying. That is why we are testing whether an algorithm can help us determine which applications should and should not be investigated. So that Amsterdammers suffer less from our enforcement and so that fewer Amsterdammers get into trouble. But also to ensure that the provision of assistance remains affordable.Currently, an employee determines whether an application is worthy of investigation and whether this should be assessed by an employee with additional powers. The 'Smart Check' algorithm supports the caseworker to determine whether a subsistence application is investigation-worthy. The algorithm makes transparent and explainable which data led to the label 'research-worthy'. All data used to arrive at an assessment are documented and described. PilotFrom April to July 2023, the municipality is conducting a pilot with a new working method. In this pilot, the 'smart check' algorithm determines whether an application is labelled 'research-worthy' or 'not research-worthy'. This is then checked by an employee of Enforcement Work and Income. The algorithm can find connections and patterns in a large amount of information on requested social assistance benefits and determines which information is more likely to be associated with applications that required further investigation and which are not. 'Smart Check' is trained on historical data and consists of 15 data points. Upon completion of the pilot, we will determine whether this way of working is better for Amsterdam citizens. Link to service: https://www.amsterdam.nl/werk-inkomen/","
This new approach to the pilot has a number of advantages:

Equivalence: We analysed the bias ('bias') of the algorithm. This showed that on almost all sensitive characteristics (such as age, country of birth and nationality), the developed model treats different groups more equally than it does now.
Effectiveness: The model can assess which applications are worthy of investigation better than a staff member. As a result, capacity can be better utilised, and fewer unlawful benefits are issued.
Proportionality: Because the model can better estimate which applications require additional checking, it is less common for applications to be examined unnecessarily. This leads to better proportionality. We also prevent the unlawful provision of benefits more often, leading to a more preventive rather than repressive approach.

Not everyone who submits an application is entitled to benefits. The employees of the Income Support Department process many applications based on the information in the application form and the documents provided. In those cases, it is clear that the applicant is entitled to benefits. Sometimes the information is not complete or unambiguous. Then it may be necessary to carry out additional research. This is done by staff from the Work and Income Enforcement Department.The 'Smart Check' algorithm supports staff in assessing life support applications by labelling them as worthy or not worthy of investigation. All life maintenance applications are presented to 'Smart check'.When an Amsterdam resident submits a maintenance application, the application enters the Income Directorate's application to process the application. The applications are offered to 'Smart check' and 'Smart check' uses the following data to give the application the label 'research-worthy' or 'not research-worthy': From the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP)BSNInformation about home address  Information on housing situation From the applications of the Income Department BSNInformation about possible previous social assistance benefitsInformation about assets Information about incomeApplications labelled 'research-worthy' are processed by employees of the Work and Income Enforcement Department.

An Income Support staff member may still transfer a life maintenance application to a Work and Income Enforcement staff member for additional investigation.The employee of the Income Support Department makes the decision on the life maintenance application. The decision may be: an application is granted, rejected or dismissed.

The algorithm only advises whether an application needs additional investigation. After this advice, several employees carry out further extensive research.First, an employee from the Work and Income Enforcement Department checks whether the application is really worth investigating.If it is, another employee from the Work and Income Enforcement Department will conduct an extensive investigation into its legitimacy. An opinion is issued on this and yet another employee (from Inkomensvoorziening) makes the final decision.So there is no automated decision-making. There is meaningful human intervention before a decision is made. Work instructions are drawn up to avoid too much trust in the outcome of the model (""automation bias""). In addition, employees undergo training on how to use the information from the model in their work process.  ","
For this product, we relied on the General Court of Auditors' Framework. In addition, the main risk management analyses were done the DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment), KIIA (Artificial Intelligence Impact Assessment), IAMA (Human Rights and Algorithms Impact Assessment ) and the BIO Quickscan. These indicated the extent to which the risks can be eliminated or reduced, and what the residual risks are. We have taken several measures to ensure that the output of the model is correct, transparent and consistent. 
The model will also be closely monitored during the pilot (and in case of a successful pilot during management) to ensure the quality and fairness of the model also in the future.

The data will not be used for anything else and deleted after the objection period expires. The algorithm used detects non-relevant license plates and persons in the photos and makes them unrecognisable. ","The following is a functional explanation of how the algorithm works and the process in which it is used:
 


The scan car drives through the street on public roads in areas where parking is allowed only if paid for or one has a parking permit
Different types of cameras on the scan car (infrared, colour and panoramic cameras) automatically scan the license plates of all cars located in the area to be enforced
A GEO position is linked to each license plate
The scanned data is securely transmitted to Brickyard's back office
The algorithm uses a geographic map provided by the municipality containing all relevant parking information to check whether the geo-position of the license plate is in a given parking area
The data is filtered by the system and then the parking rights database (National Parking Register) is queried
If the license plate is not in there, a parking controller goes to the parked car and assesses the situation on the spot. If there are no details, the enforcer confirms that a fine (this is officially called post-parking tax assessment) will be sent to the owner of the car.

","An enforcer checks on the spot if there really is no payment and assesses the situation. If there is no special situation, a parking fine follows.","The main risk is that the system misrecognises a license plate number and someone who does not deserve it is fined. This can happen if a character on the license plate is wrongly recognised.

Still, an algorithm can never completely determine someone's suitability for an occupation or job. The characteristics associated with the professions, the weighting factors that determine the skill profile and how a person felt while taking the tests also determine the outcome. The algorithm is a tool to give a jobseeker an insight into his/her talents and which occupations would fit well with them in a fun way. The results are discussed with the candidates to check whether the outcome is recognisable. The results of the algorithm are tracked over a longer period to assess whether the algorithm is effective in practice.",The Participation Act aims to guide as many people as possible who are able to work into employment and/or support them in their work. The municipality has the task of guiding residents with a distance to the labour market to suitable work. Passport for Work is a tool that can help make a good link between available jobs and jobseekers.,1.0,,team@passportforwork.nl,nld,,"
The following data are used by the algorithm:

Skills of job seekers:  The structure of this consists of data on behaviour, personality (measured by a science-based personality questionnaire), skills, motivation (measured by the RIASEC model), self-assessment and experience based on CV.
Skills that come with a job: A nationwide survey of employers, employees and sector representatives provided the information on which skills are important for a particular occupation, and at what level the skills are important. This was initially done for 24 occupations, in the construction, healthcare and engineering sectors.

","
Below is the functional explanation of how the algorithm works.
 


Algorithm to determine a job seeker's skill profile: Passport for Work maps job seekers' skills through a combination of self-assessment, neurogames and online role plays. Based on these tests, the algorithm determines the skill profile. This is a schematic overview of a jobseeker's skills.




Skill profile of professions and jobs: Each profession within Passport for Work has its own skill profile. This skill profile consists of an overview of competences a candidate must have for that profession. An employer can enter a vacancy for a particular profession. The employer can adopt the skill profile for that profession one-to-one or modify the profile.




Matching algorithm: The matching algorithm first looks at hard requirements such as possession of a driving licence, commuting distance or available working days. These are the so-called 'knock-out criteria'. But most importantly, it assesses whether a jobseeker has or can develop the skills that go with the job. The algorithm looks at how far a jobseeker's profile matches the job profile. It does this based on a weighting matrix. This translates the results of the tests into a score on each of the competences from the O*NET system. The highest score means the competency matches exactly what is needed. The score for all competences together determines a person's possible suitability for a profession and job. The degree of possible suitability is indicated from most suitable to least suitable always showing all results.


","

A case manager, career counselor or supervisor discusses the skill profile with the jobseeker. They discuss whether they think the skill profile is correct and whether the job suggestions made by Password for Work fit.
A jobseeker decides whether the skill profile will be visible to employers.
A job seeker always gets to see all jobs and an employer all candidates. The algorithm only determines the order of jobs and job seekers. 

","

Circumstances while completing the tests can have a negative impact on the outcome. For example, if the job seeker is disturbed, unable to concentrate properly, the computer or the internet is not working properly, then the conclusion may be wrongly drawn that the job seeker is not fast enough and therefore receives a lower rating.


Subjectivity or cultural influence: The matching system is based on current knowledge within psychometrics. However, cultural influences or subjectivity cannot be ruled out. The likelihood of such effects is difficult to estimate, but if they occur, they can have negative consequences for those involved.


Incorrect matching: There is a chance that, due to bugs or unforeseen issues, the measured competences or the calculation of the match is not correct. Then the outcome may be a less appropriate advice.


Limited matching: Passport for work cannot advise towards occupations and/or sectors not included in Passport for Work. As a result, jobseekers may miss out on an opportunity for (better) suitable work.

Information Supported Decision - Short-stay (Schengen) Visa (CDV),Ministry of Foreign Affairs,The algorithm (classification model) supports in processing an application for a Short Stay Schengen Visa. This is called Information Supported Decision Making (IOB).,"Organisation and business operations, International",NL:  Factsheet Informatie Ondersteunend Beslissen ; ENG:  Factsheet Information-supported decision-making,In use,"The algorithm is used to support the processing of Short Stay Visa applications within Schengen countries. In doing so, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (BZ) implements the government task assigned to BZ.The IOB contributes to the assessment process of short-stay Schengen visas for the purpose of promoting economic diplomacy, family visits and tourism and preventing any threats to public order, security and settlement.The visa application is assessed using the following information: (1) information submitted by the applicant himself to BZ; (2) information from the sponsor and/or employer; (3) information from the migration chain (see under 'data sources'); and (4) information from profiles based on similar past applications.The conditions for obtaining a visa are and will remain the same for everyone, regardless of previous applications or those for which a sponsor has stood as guarantor. These conditions have been agreed between Schengen countries and laid down in the EU Visa Code. The use of the algorithm is supportive for deciding on an application, but never a ground for refusing a visa. The impact of using the algorithm is therefore minimal.","It is not possible for decision-makers to manually access all relevant information with the application. Thanks to the algorithm's treatment advice, they can handle applications more carefully and efficiently, they can better assess whether, for example, additional information is needed, or an additional interview should be conducted.In addition, the handling of applications becomes more objective, as the treatment is no longer based solely on the decision officer's judgement, but also supported by data.  ","Performance of government task (Art. 6(1)(e) AVG, Art. 2(2) Kingdom Act) ",1.0,niet openbaar,DCV-BAO@minbuza.nl,nld,nog niet openbaar,"Support using the algorithm is provided in two ways: 1) the application is compared with the available data (from BZ and information received from the migration chain) and 2) the application is compared with similar applications from the past (using profiles).The outcome of this comparison is an advice to the decision officer handling the application, and provides additional insight when estimating the intensity of the preliminary examination of the visa application.The data used are the following: (1) information provided by the applicant in the application form submitted to BZ; (2) information from the sponsor and/or employer; (3) information from the migration chain (see under 'data sources); and (4) profile information based on similar past applications.For a complete overview of data, see also the factsheet https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/binaries/content/assets/pdfs-nederlands/factsheet-informatie-ondersteund-beslissen-visum-kort-verblijf-kvv-maart-2023.pdf","Comparison with the data present is done through the so-called hit/no hit principle. If there is information about the applicant, the sponsor or the employer in the BZ database, there is a hit. There is therefore a match between the information entered on the application form and the information known to BZ from the database. In addition, the application is compared with the profiles present. Here too, the hit/no hit principle is used. Here, the characteristics of the profile are compared with the specific characteristics from the application form. For example, the purpose of travel and the place where the visa application was submitted. When there is a match between the characteristics from the profiles and the application form, there is a hit. A profile is set of characteristics established after an analysis of historical data available at BZ. It is not a personal profile that says something about an individual, but about a similar (large) group of visa applicants. Profiles are established by BZ after careful analysis. For instance, profiles must meet various conditions before they are deployed by BZ.The algorithm is classified as a classification system and works on the basis of predetermined simple 'if-then rules'.",It is and remains up to the decision-maker to decide the next step in the application and whether a visa is ultimately granted or refused. There is thus (meaningful) human intervention.  ,Final decisions on an application are monitored by BZ. These decisions are compared with the supporting advice given by the algorithm. This monitors whether decision-makers do not 'blind' to the algorithm's treatment advice by automatically basing an approval or a rejection on it. ,Internally developed,Opvraagbaar bij het Ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken,"Schengen visa, Short-stay visa, KVV, EU visa code",Niet open source,"2017

This involves looking at the bank balance and interest received per account on 31 December of the previous year. Is the total amount of all accounts higher than the set limit? Then a signal is sent. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment redefines this asset limit every year.A signal is also sent if the interest received on the accounts exceeds a certain percentage* of the asset limit. This signal is based on the composition of the household and the wealth limit associated with it.*The interest rate used is the average 'savings market rate' as it applied in the previous tax year.","The 'Signal equity balance/interest' is part of the information service 'Samenloopsignalering'. For general questions about this service, you can also consult the 'Samenloopsignalering' algorithm. In this description, we specifically explain the operation of the 'Signal equity balance/interest'.Assistance is provided to persons who do not have the means to meet the necessary living expenses. Resources are defined as all the assets of a household. Does the total assets of the benefit recipient exceed the asset limit? Then the right to the benefit lapses. This event can be delivered as a signal to the municipality / Social Insurance Bank (SVB) using information from the Tax Office.A point of attention here is that the information available for this is by definition not up to date. The asset situation on 31 December of the previous fiscal year is made available by the Tax Administration to the IB from May/June in the following year. There is no other national source. With this signal and its own follow-up investigation, municipalities can terminate unjustified benefits (retroactively) if necessary.The algorithm ensures that a municipality only receives the data of their own residents on welfare benefits who may have excess assets.

ChangeMapp - change in the outdoor space,Province of South Holland,"ChangeMapp performs automatic map/image comparisons and object detection, applying proprietary artificial intelligence to signal and point out where the map is incorrect (change detection). ","Space and Infrastructure, Traffic",,In use,"The province has a legal responsibility to keep (parts of) the Basic Registration of Large-Scale Topography (BGT) up to date and organise proper management and maintenance of its infrastructure. The ChangeMapp algorithm helps to keep the BGT and the overview of the infrastructure to be managed up to date, while showing that this information is current. From 2024, in the ENSIA BGT self-assessment, regulator BZK asks for the deployment of mutation detection. The aim is to make mutations (changes) in outdoor space easier to detect. Have there been changes to structures (BGT/BAG) or changes in grey/green/blue objects (BGT)? Have dormers (WOZ) and solar panels been installed? With ChangeMapp, we get a geographical or administrative file with the relevant changes, or mutations, compared to the current BGT, BAG or WOZ.","The algorithm is an efficient way to compare the 'outside world' with the 'data inside world'. Other methods considered are more labour- and/or cost-intensive. Other methods include manual image tracing, LiDAR scan cars, data reacquisition, and sampling regimes. The disadvantages are minimal because the results are not directly processable and thus always require human assessment, no personal data are processed, and only public sources are consulted.","The algorithm is mainly used for the Large-Scale Topography Registration Act and also indirectly for the Roads Act.

The algorithm is not self-learning.Aerial photos are analysed and the application indicates by means of a colour area on the photo where mutations relative to the map have taken place. The results of ChangeMapp are baseline measurements, alerts and/or mappings of objects relevant for the BGT, BAG and WOZ. These are delivered as geometric files (e.g. Shapefiles), administrative files (e.g. Excel) and work projects (e.g. QGIS projects). The current scope of objects handled is:Signalling and mapping of structures against the BGT, BAG or composite map of structures.Signalling of grey/green/blue objects with respect to the BGT.Zero measurement and/or indication of dormers compared to the WOZ.Zero measurement and/or signalling of solar panels compared to the WOZ or another reference file.The results are provided with several attributes such as classifications and other object properties.The province only uses the BGT side of the algorithm and is an (optional) part of the regular data quality processes of the province's BGT data managers.","The algorithm produces a geo-file, which is reviewed by data managers from the provinces. The algorithm does not make any adjustments itself, nor does it make concrete suggestions for adjustments, but only identifies locations with a potential mutation. Data managers then collect the missing data on a regular basis and update the relevant data with it.","The legal and ethical risks are limited because the results cannot be processed directly and therefore always require human assessment.

Anonymisation software,Municipality of Altena,"The algorithm underlines personal data in documents. An employee has to look at all pages and check whether the document is properly anonymised. Then the software removes all highlighted information and blacklists it. After that, the documents can be published, for example under the Open Government Act.",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation software is used to anonymise documents published by the municipality faster and better.

Therefore, privacy- or business-sensitive information has to be lacquered out. Before the algorithm was deployed, this deleting did not always go well. There were data breaches where not all personal data was deleted or where deleted information could still be read. The advantage of anonymisation software is that anonymisation is faster and better. The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server. The content is not stored on this server, so the privacy risk of using the algorithm does not outweigh the privacy benefit of reducing the number of data breaches due to improper anonymisation. ",1.

At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8. Minimum key figures for the accuracy of identifying personal data are as follows: Named entities (precision): 0.78, Named entities (recall): 0.76, Named entities (F-score): 0.77.Finally, a staff member checks the document and when it completes the document, the data to be anonymised is permanently removed from the text layer and a black bar is placed.",The outcome of the algorithm is checked by an employee. The clerk is required by the software to check all pages. The clerk determines whether the document is correctly anonymised.,"There is no risk of automated decision-making and the algorithm has no impact on fundamental rights because the algorithm does not make decisions with legal consequences. It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer itself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists.The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm.The last risk that remains is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

The Tax and Customs Administration observes the general principles of good governance when applying and developing algorithms.Conditions, a quality framework, have been drawn up by the Tax and Customs Administration for the development of algorithms. This contains rules and agreements that are followed during algorithm development. The conditions of the Audit Service Rijk (ADR) are leading in this respect. At regular intervals, the Tax and Customs Administration checks whether the algorithm still meets the quality requirements.The algorithm uses data collected under various tax laws. As required by the AVG, no more data is used than necessary. The algorithm and selection rules are evaluated annually. If necessary, the selection rules are adjusted in cooperation with the tax inspector to remain compliant with laws and regulations.",The algorithm was developed in-house at the Inland Revenue and is also maintained internally.,,,,,,Privacy and AVGThe use of data should be assessed against the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG). Reviewing personal data reveals any privacy risks and allows appropriate measures to be taken.The AVG prescribes that no more data should be used than necessary. This is called data minimisation. The Tax Administration regularly examines whether the data used are still necessary and can therefore be used. The algorithm does not use any special personal data.,Impactful algorithms,"1: Algemene wet Bestuursrecht (Awb), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537/. 2: Algemene wet inzake rijksbelastingen (Awr), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0002320/. 3:  Wet algemene bepalingen burgerservicenummer (Wabb), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0022428/. 4: Wet op de omzetbelasting 1968, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0002629/. 5: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG), https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/NL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679. 6: Uitvoeringswet algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (uAVG), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 7: Archiefwet 1995, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0007376/",,"1: Identificerende gegevens, Basisregistratie Personen (BRP). 2: Aangiftegegevens en aanslaggegevens Omzetbelasting , Belastingdienst",84713719

Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security.

With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely.

Algorithm subsidy scheme Energy Cost Contribution (TEK),Netherlands Enterprise Agency,"The algorithm is used to perform automated risk assessment for all Energy Cost Contribution applications, prior to automated or manual granting and payment of the advance.",Economy,,Out of use,"
With the deployment of the algorithm, decision making is accelerated so that as many entrepreneurs as possible can receive grants on time. The algorithm speeds up the decision-making process for awarding a grant, and it provides risk guidance for the manual flow.
","
The use of the algorithm in TEK applications ensures that entrepreneurs' applications can be processed quickly and efficiently. Most of the entrepreneurs have the money in their accounts quickly. When an application fails to manual check, an employee has to assess the application. In that case, it takes longer for a decision on the allowance to be made, resulting in the money being in the entrepreneur's account later
","
The algorithm will be used for tasks under the Energy Cost Contribution Scheme.
",1.0,,Via contactformulier: https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/contact/formulier,nld,,"
The algorithm uses data on turnover, energy consumption, energy connections, Chamber of Commerce data and data from the entrepreneur's own application.
","

RFO deploys an algorithm to support the assessment of applications from entrepreneurs. This algorithm tests whether an application meets the conditions set by the minister. This is done using a risk model: when an application arrives at RFO, an estimate is made as to whether the entrepreneur is actually entitled to the allowance.
Here, for example, RFO compares the applicant's declared information with other data, such as VAT declarations at the Tax Administration and consumption values at the grid operators.
An application is automatically approved when the algorithm classifies the application as low risk, for example because the amount claimed by the applicant is low and there are no indications of abuse or improper use. In that case, no more employee is involved.

","  The risk model determines the qualitative and quantitative risk of each application; those factors together form the overall risk category. In case the algorithm identifies an application as high risk, it falls out to a manual check by a staff member. For example, because the amount is high, the application is incomplete, or there is evidence of abuse or improper use. The application is then prepared for human review. The algorithm gives advice to the employee on what to look out for, such as data that is incomplete or contradictory. This can be useful: the advice helps the clerk to get a quick picture of the situation. The clerk then reviews the entire application. The clerk can then approve or reject applications, possibly after a further request for information. A negative decision (no grant or lower grant) therefore does not follow from the risk model but always from an employee's assessment. Any deviation from the customer request and grant amounts above a certain limit are always done through the four-eye principle.","
The risk model is submitted for approval to an interdepartmental advisory committee (rolling review), which advises the general director RFO on the application of the risk model. Only after they advise positively on the use of the algorithm (or a change to it) will the algorithm be put into use.

Anonymisation tool,Municipality of Hilversum,"The algorithm in the software is mainly set to recognise and anonymise privacy-sensitive information in documents. Basis for this is the AVG. The tool is also used to highlight and mask information that cannot be shared for other reasons (based on another basis, e.g. the Woo) in a document.","Organisation and business operations, Law",,In use,"The anonymisation tool is used to give substance to transparency and the necessary protection of the individuals, companies and institutions to whom documents relate.Transparency because it enables the organisation to share information according to regulations such as the Woo. For the resident about whom there is data in documents to be published, use means that there is no privacy violation and the organisation thus complies with the AVG. The same applies to the protection of personal data of the organisation's employees.The applicant of a Woo request receives the information she asked for, either in anonymised version or partially masked on a different basis. For the departments within the organisation responsible for handling a Woo request and/or publishing information, it means complying with laws and regulations. Use of the software reduces turnaround time and therefore contributes to being able to provide requested information within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low. This applies to individuals (citizens, employees of buying organisations). The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and masks or designates them regardless of the further content of documents. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to an employee, there are no automatic decisions. In addition, the tool has the option of manually masking information that cannot be made public for other reasons. With this, for example, a text fragment containing strategic information can be marked to protect one's own organisation or a partner organisation (government, company or institution). The basis for anonymising or masking is indicated in the box.","It happens that text excerpts in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo has provided Foundations on the basis of which that is possible. And the AVG is also such a basis for non-Woo publications. Without the use of the software, anonymising text fragments in documents would take much more time. Using the anonymisation tool speeds up and simplifies the process for active and passive disclosure. Automated anonymisation is also less error-prone than human intervention alone. This reduces the risk of a data breach and better protects individuals' data.",General data protection regulation (AVG)Environment ActGeneral Administrative Law Act (AWB)Disclosure ActOpen Government Act (Woo)Electronic Publications Act (Wep),1.0,,privacy@hilversum.nl,nld,,"At the beginning of use, a setup document was compiled by organisation and supplier. This contains preferences of the organisation regarding anonymisation. This set is merged with Octobox's Basic Model, which by default looks for persons traceable data, such as Citizen Service Numbers, Bank Account Numbers, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, dates, residential addresses and postal codes.The organisation may have a preference not to mask out certain names (minister, director) and others. Staff names may be missing from the Basic Model and added in advance. Another preference the organisation may indicate is, for example, the format in which an e-mail address is made unrecognisable.","Based on smart rules, the software searches through the texts of every document in the offered file. Certain texts, words or character combinations are recognised as traceable data, such as Citizen Service Numbers, Bank Account Numbers, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, dates, residential addresses and postal codes.The software can be set to the degree of certainty in which a condition is met. For the employee, the screen indicates which text fragments should be lacquered with certainty, and which meet the established smart rule to a lesser extent. Through the screen, the employee can approve or reject the proposals, and also amend for approval. The collaborator can also mark text itself and make it eligible for varnishing, including adding a basis. It is possible for a second collaborator to check the work of the first. Once all (pages of all) documents in the file have been reviewed, the final version is created, in a suitable format for publication.","The software works on the basis of a setup document. Through this setup document and various mechanisms, the organisation can tailor the algorithm use to its own situation. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to an employee. No automated decisions are involved.The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and marks or designates it regardless of the further content of documents. The employee handles the suggestions and indicates where they are correct, corrects where it should. Optionally, this work can also be reviewed within the software by a second person. For the resident, this means that the organisation is demonstrably and proportionately working to eliminate (the risk of) privacy breaches and thus comply with the AVG.","To reduce the risk of documents being insufficiently anonymised, a check is always performed by an employee. This involves a full check where the software can be used intuitively to check or modify/enrich. If there were no human control when anonymising documents, various risks could arise, especially as a result of disclosing or publishing privacy-sensitive data. This tool in conjunction with humans, helps prevent this:Violation of privacy laws:The inadvertent disclosure of personal data may constitute a violation of privacy laws, such as the EU's AVG. This can lead to significant fines and legal penalties.Identity theft:Disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, address and BSN can lead to identity theft and financial fraud.Damage to reputation:Both the reputation of the individuals whose information has been leaked and that of the organisation responsible for the leak can be seriously damaged.Loss of trust:The confidence of the public and affected stakeholders in the organisation may decrease, leading to a decline in engagement and support.Personal damage:Individuals may suffer emotional and psychological damage if their personal data is made public.Exploitation and misuse:Disclosed data can be used for malicious purposes, such as strike, harassment or discrimination.Human monitoring helps to mitigate these risks by providing additional assessment and confirmation that anonymisation processes have been adequately carried out before information is made public.",Octobox Netherlands B.V.,,"Anonymising, information request",,2021-09,,,Other algorithms,"1: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 2: Omgevingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037885. 3: Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht (AWB), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537. 4: Bekendmakingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004287. 5: Wet open overheid (WOO), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754. 6: Wet elektronische publicaties (WEP), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961",,,21544327
Risk scan of Negligent Unemployment,Employee Insurance Agency,Helps us spot possible culpable unemployment.,"Social Security, Work",,In use,"When you apply for WW benefits from us, we want to know that you did not become unemployed through no fault of your own. If you did, you are culpably unemployed. You will then not be entitled to WW benefit. To identify possible culpable unemployment in WW applications, we use the Risk Scan Culpable Unemployment.","The risk scan was developed to better identify culpable unemployment without having to check every file. This allows us to focus more on customer focus rather than control.

This data is mainly about someone's behaviour. We therefore call them behavioural characteristics.
 
We do not disclose all the data and behavioural characteristics used by the risk scan. Otherwise, the outcome of the risk scan may be affected.
 
The risk scan uses 3 types of data:
 


data about (possible) previous WW applications and benefits)

(e.g. how often you have received unemployment benefit, on what date it started(s) and whether you were previously culpably unemployed)



details of your employment history


(e.g. how long your longest employment lasted)


details of your current WW claim


(e.g. when you made the application)","
The risk scan determines the risk of culpable unemployment based on a combination of several data. This is therefore never done on the basis of a single behavioural characteristic or data. High-risk applications are presented to our staff for extensive examination. 
 
It is important to know that the risk scan only signals. A signal does not indicate whether or not someone is culpably unemployed, but is a trigger for staff to carry out a check. Our employees themselves determine whether there is culpable unemployment or not.
","
Our staff monitor the use of the algorithm in the following ways:
 


The employee himself assesses the WW application and makes his own decision on the possible next steps. The risk scan therefore does not make any decisions about benefit entitlement. 




Every month, specialised UWV employees check the quality of the data used by the risk scan. The proper functioning of the scan is also monitored. In this way, we constantly check whether the scan continues to meet our quality standards. For example, we check whether the population used in developing the risk scan is still representative. 




The risk scan is regularly developed further so that it only uses data that adds value to its operation. We remove data that does not (or no longer) add value. We also regularly check whether there are still opportunities to improve the scan.


","
We ensure that we remain compliant with information security and privacy requirements. We do this in the following ways:
 


We constantly check data quality. 




We always ensure that employees do the final assessment and not the algorithm. 




If a scan is (re)developed by us, the quality of our work is reviewed by an independent, reputable organisation. This way, we reduce the chances of errors or sub-optimal quality. 




We use data provided by the client as much as possible.




With the following measures, we ensure the correct use of the Risk Scan Blamable Unemployment:
 


The algorithm always uses the same data and behavioural characteristics.




The risk scan does not use personal characteristics such as origin, gender, age or other privacy-sensitive data.




The risk scan does not use data from social media or other public sources. This way, we treat everyone the same and human biases do not affect treatment.




The risk scan produces a selection of signals that staff investigate further. A number (30%) of randomly selected WW applications are always added to this selection. So the employee does not know whether a signal comes from the risk scan or from the applications added at random. In this way, we ensure that employees are not influenced and remain critical of situations they have to investigate. 




The algorithm only signals. An employee assesses whether there is actual culpable unemployment or not.




Only the applications that pass the risk scan (including the 30% randomly selected WW applications added to it) are additionally checked and examined by our employees.

Job search scan WW,Employee Insurance Agency,The Job Application Scan WW shows us whether you need help finding work. ,"Social Security, Work",,In use,"To get WW benefit, it is important that you actively look for work. The Job Application Scan WW shows us whether you may need extra support in this. That way we can help you find a new job faster and better.",,WW benefit,1.0,https://www.uwv.nl/nl/over-uwv/organisatie/algoritmeregister-uwv/sollicitatiescan-ww,https://www.uwv.nl/nl/service-en-contact/contact-uwv,nld,,"
The Job Application Scan WW uses personal information from your Work Folder and from UWV's systems. UWV may use this personal information to carry out our statutory duty to increase your chances of finding work.
The Job Application Scan first uses information necessary to determine whether you are a client who may be eligible for additional support in finding work. This includes the following information:

your citizen service number (BSN)
the start and end date of your unemployment benefit 
whether your benefit is higher than 0 
whether you receive a lower benefit, for example because you have income from work in addition to your WW benefit 
what kind of services you are offered by the UWV 
the job application activities you have reported to UWV 
whether you are (partially) exempt from the obligation to apply for a job 
whether you have received an accountability order from UWV, because you have not applied for work enough, for example


Does the above information show that you belong to the group of clients who may be able to get help? Then the Job Application Scan WW also uses information about how you apply for a job. You keep this information in your Work Folder. It involves the following data:

How many different activities you do in order to apply for a job 
How often you have your first job interview 
How often you call an employer 
How often you apply for a vacancy 
how often you have networking meetings 
how many different contacts you passed on 
what information you pass on about your contacts 
how many different organisations you are in contact with 
how many hours there are on average between all your job search activities 
how many hours on average there is between reporting your job search activities


Furthermore, the algorithm still uses information about your availability, your employment history and your WW entitlement:

the number of hours you are available for work
what your employment history looks like 
how many days of your unemployment benefit have been used up 
what percentage of your WW benefit is exhausted 
how many days you are still entitled to WW benefit 
how many days there are between the application and start date of your WW benefit

","All data together give a score. This score is generated by comparing your data with the same data we have on other clients. If the score shows that you may need support in applying for a job, we will investigate this. A UWV employee will then map out your personal situation. This includes looking at your employment history, education and application activities. If the employee also thinks you could use help, we invite you for a personal interview. We will then discuss with you which type of support is best for you.","
UWV employees monitor the use of the algorithm in the following ways:

The employee decides whether we will provide you with additional support when applying for a job. The employee also decides together with you how we will do this. So the algorithm does not make any decisions itself. 
Every week, specialised UWV employees check the results of the Job Application Scan WW. They also check whether the algorithm uses the correct data. 
As soon as we see that the Job Application Scan WW does not give the results we expect, we start a technical investigation into the cause. Do we find something wrong? Then we adjust the Job Application Scan WW.

","
We ensure that we remain compliant with information security and privacy requirements. We do this in the following ways:

We continuously work on algorithm maintenance. 
We have carried out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (GEB). An GEB identifies what personal data is used, in what way and whether the privacy of data subjects is adequately protected. The GEB proposes measures to mitigate privacy risks. 
We comply with the Archives Act by deleting data that is not (or no longer) important. 
We have both independent organisations and internal audit departments audit our compliance with legal and ethical standards on an annual basis. We also do this when changes are made to the Job Application Scan WW. 
An external and independent organisation carries out quality checks to test whether the algorithm is careful. This is done in addition to the standard checks our specialist UWV staff already do annually. In 2022, the external audit was carried out by consultancy firm KPMG.



The Job Application Scan WW has been developed so that everyone on WW benefit is treated in the same way. This is done as follows:

The Job Application Scan WW does not use personal characteristics such as origin, gender or age. 
The Job Application Scan WW always uses the same data from everyone. The algorithm processes all data in the same way. 
To the selection of clients that comes out of the Job Application Scan WW, we always add a number (30%) of clients on unemployment benefit who were not chosen by the algorithm. So when conducting the survey, our staff do not know whether data come from the Job Application Scan WW or from the group added randomly. They also do not see which score a client has received. In this way, we ensure that employees are not influenced in their decision to offer support or not.

If one or more particulars are found, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There it is checked by a member of the civil affairs team.

Zivver,Municipality of Dalfsen,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security.

Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm.

The next time a person asks a similar question, the answer that helped the most is more likely to be chosen. GEM can thus provide substantive answers to questions based on this library, as well as refer to an information page or have a staff member continue the conversation.

It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. When the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists. The FUMO employee always does the final check whether a document has been anonymised correctly. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified. The risks do not outweigh the privacy benefits and the risk of poor anonymisation by not using this software.",Xxllnc,,,,05-2023,,,Other algorithms,"1: Woo, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754/. 2: WDO, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/NL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046. 3: UAVG, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 4: Wep, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961. 5: Wdo, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0048156",1: DEDA anonimiseringssoftware. 2: DPIA anonimiseringssoftware,,94584934

Supervision declaration of private use of car (VPGA),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,The 'Statement of Private Use (Van) Car (VPGA)' algorithm helps Tax Administration staff monitor correct and complete deduction and remittance of payroll taxes. The VPGA algorithm helps Tax Administration employees to respond to the potentially incorrect application of statements of private use (van) car.,Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"The Tax Authority supervises the correct and complete declaration and remittance of payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are taxes and contributions that withholding agents (such as employer, pension fund or benefits agency) withhold from (wage tax and national insurance contributions) and pay on (employee insurance contributions and income-dependent healthcare insurance contributions) their employees' wages. The VPGA algorithm helps Tax Administration staff monitor proper compliance with legislation relevant to payroll taxes. A statement no private car use can be requested by an employee if the conditions are met.The VPGA algorithm is designed to detect the wrongly omitted addition to the private use of a car when the statement no private use car is used. The algorithm combines different types of data to detect indications of situations in which there may be an incorrectly omitted addition to the private use of the car and thus an underpayment of payroll taxes.The algorithm detects that there is no logical explanation for the fact that, for tax purposes, there is a period of additional private use of the car and a period of no additional use of the car due to the use of a statement of no private use. An addition period does mean that it is apparently not possible to provide evidence for the entire calendar year that no more than 500 kilometres were driven for private purposes.

If this contact shows that the addition was rightly omitted, the investigation is closed. If this investigation shows that there is no proof that no more than 500 kilometres were driven for private purposes on a calendar year basis, an additional assessment for payroll taxes will be imposed.","Supervision of correct application of car use statementIf, for example, the statement no private use of car is applied incorrectly, no or too little payroll taxes are wrongly paid.When a car is made available by the employer, it is taxed with a fixed amount as wages in kind, i.e. the additional taxable benefit for the private use of the car. The employer (withholding agent) may omit the additional taxable benefit if it can be proven that the car was driven for private purposes for no more than 500 kilometres on a calendar year.The employer (withholding agent) can also omit the addition for private use of the car if he has received a copy of the car use statement from the employee.The employee can request this decision from the Tax Administration. When handing over the statement to the employer, the burden of proof that no more than 500 kilometres for private use have been driven with the car(s) made available on a calendar year basis will be on the employee. Any additional taxes will thus fall on the employee. Advantages of using algorithmMonitoring private car use is important for the accuracy of the payroll tax return. The algorithm can support a Tax Administration employee in this.

At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible.

The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

These algorithms help Inland Revenue employees monitor the correct and complete withholding and remittance of payroll taxes and the correct and timely submission of employee data in the payroll tax return. Payroll taxes are taxes and contributions that withholding agents (such as employer, pension fund or benefits agency) withhold from (wage tax and national insurance contributions) and pay on (employee insurance contributions and income-dependent healthcare insurance contributions) their employees' wages. In addition, the Tax Authority monitors the accuracy of the employee data from the wage tax return. Withholding agents periodically submit the wage tax return to the Tax and Customs Administration. The UWV and the Tax and Customs Administration check for anomalous data. The Tax and Customs Administration periodically reports back to withholding agents any errors found in the employee data received from the wage tax returns. The withholding agents are requested to rectify the observed inaccuracies per return period. A description of this process is published on the ""Wage declaration chain"" site. (https://www.loonaangifteketen.nl/)A description of these error reports and a description and explanation of each error possibly contained therein is published on the Tax and Customs Administration's site under ""Payroll taxes"" and then ""Explanation of error reports employee data"".

The following three algorithms are used for this purpose: ","Not Recovered Well Feedback (NHWT). The NHWT algorithm is designed to detect employers who repeatedly make errors in employee data.The algorithm leads to surveillance of a limited group of withholding agents of large enterprises that mostly make the same errors in returns. This group accounts for half of the repeat errors. Based on the indications from the algorithm, the handler can request in writing the correction or approach the withholding agent by phone to take measures to reduce the number of errors in the returns. This algorithm looks at various errors in employee data. The following two algorithms check a specific error message:BSN birth date differences The BSN birth date differences algorithm is designed to detect withholding agents with repeated incorrect application of the BSN data. Based on the indications from the algorithm, the handler can contact the withholding agent to expedite the correction of the identified BSN-related errors in payroll tax returns. This involves adjustments to the BSN declared or BSN birth date differences.Sector differences The Sector Differences algorithm is designed to detect withholding agents who employ employees in the event of an incorrect application of the sector code in a number of consecutive payroll tax returns. For employee insurance purposes, the business and professional sector is divided into a number of sectors. Each sector consists of one or more business or professional sectors or parts thereof. A withholding agent is compulsorily affiliated to one of the sectors. Which sector it belongs to depends on its social function and/or the nature of its activities. The starting point is that withholding agents with the same activities are affiliated with the same sector. The sector is important because the sector affiliation determines the amount of the WGA and ZW premium to be paid. The correct data is also important for the hundreds of buyers of wage declaration data.Based on the indications from the algorithm, the handler can contact employers who, after a number of written correction requests to correct the indicated sector, have still not made a change.

Starting foreign companies for payroll taxes,Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,The algorithm 'Starting Foreign Companies for Payroll Taxes' helps Tax Administration staff to monitor correct and complete deduction and remittance of payroll taxes for foreign companies. The algorithm helps Tax Administration employees respond to potentially incorrect returns. ,Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"The Tax Authority checks withholding agents for correct and complete declaration and payment of payroll taxes. Payroll taxes consist of wage tax, national insurance contributions, employee insurance and the income-related Healthcare Insurance Act contribution. Withholding agents (such as an employer, pension fund or benefits agency) deduct the wage tax and national insurance contributions from their employee's wages and pay them to the Tax Administration. The employee insurance contributions and income-dependent Healthcare Insurance Act contribution are not deducted from the employee's wage, but are paid by the employer to the Tax Administration.  The 'Starting foreign companies for Payroll Taxes' algorithm (hereafter: the Starters algorithm) looks at companies that are established abroad and carry out activities in the Netherlands, as a result of which they are obliged to file payroll tax returns in the Netherlands.The Algorithm Starters helps Tax Authorities staff monitor compliance with filing a correct payroll tax return. It is designed to target foreign companies starting up and employing employees living and/or working in the Netherlands. The algorithm looks for foreign companies where there may be a higher risk of filing an incorrect wage tax return. The algorithm leads to supervision of foreign companies starting work in the Netherlands. The adverse consequences of an incorrect return include the following:The company pays too little payroll taxes. Errors made in the returns are not corrected and keep coming back.Unnecessary additional tax assessments and fines may be imposed.Incorrect employee details are declared, with possible consequences for benefits. The Starters algorithm combines different types of data to detect indications of situations where there may be a potentially incorrect declaration. Based on the indications from the algorithm, the processor will assess the first wage declarations on certain points. This assessment will take place in different ways, depending on what is found in these wage returns. It is the Tax Administration's handler who ultimately determines whether the wage declarations contain inaccuracies. ","The Starters algorithm is important in supporting Tax Administration staff in supervising foreign start-ups that have to file payroll tax returns in the Netherlands for the first time. As a result, the assessment is more careful, efficient and unambiguous. The algorithm contributes to the systematic and accurate checking of returns. With this algorithm, the Tax and Customs Administration can deploy supervisory capacity more efficiently. The use of the algorithm increases the chances of approaching the right business for an interview or investigation.

Secure e-mailing,Municipality of Veenendaal,This algorithm helps employees of the Municipality of Veenendaal determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to contribute to the proper security of information sent by e-mail. It is used by Gemeente Veenendaal when sending e-mails to recipients outside the organisation. These include companies and citizens, for example. The algorithm ensures that security measures are not too little, but also not too much. It alerts the sender of an e-mail to possible sensitive information and encourages them to send it securely. The e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, the ability to revoke the e-mail and logging. The application also provides the ability to see if the e-mail and/or attachment have been viewed by the recipient.  In this way, sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information remains accessible to the recipient without additional friction. The algorithm only affects the process of e-mail transmission and has no impact on the material legal status of citizens or companies. ","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail. ",,1.0,,privacy@veenendaal.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages. These messages are known to have been sent securely or not. The anonymisation is done in several steps, storing only aggregates over many thousands of messages. In addition, personal data are automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages cannot be retrieved from the data. ","When creating a new e-mail, the algorithm compares the terms used in the message and attachments with previous e-mails sent. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely.","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.

However, if additional data, checks or actions are required, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There, it is checked by a civil affairs employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve an application/declaration.

This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible.

The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk.

Boating traffic model: The ""Pressure per rak"" model adds up the current and historical hourly passages per rak. Thus, we calculate the traffic intensity per rak, but not the maximum capacity of a rak. The ""Busy per rak"" model also cannot predict changes in water use. A boating traffic model is developed to map changes such as the increase or decrease of recreational boating and the effect after interventions such as a blockage or a traffic measure.

The boating traffic model has been under development since 2022 and will show capacity per stretch. How many vessels can pass per hour? Indicators of congestion (such as decrease in speed) are used to calculate the maximum capacity per rack, per hour. Predictions are made based on average travel patterns per user group. The user groups are pleasure boaters, passenger boaters and transport boaters. The data may be supplemented by data on logistics flows, tourist locations and aggregated demographic data. Only aggregated data is used in the model.","The Digital Canal:
The Digital Canal measures traffic on Amsterdam's inland waterways. The project started in 2019 under the Sailing programme. The Sailing programme falls within the Space and Economy cluster. For the project, sensors have been placed along the inland waterways in the city centre and the main waterways outside the centre of Amsterdam. By deploying these sensors, the municipality is developing a dynamic traffic model and tools for information-driven enforcement. This is done with the help of algorithms. The calculated traffic data is processed and presented in a digital overview (dashboard). The dashboard is accessible to policy advisers, nautical managers and waterway inspectors.
Within the Digital Canal, six algorithms are used: two for traffic monitoring (Pressure per lane and waterway traffic model) and four for information-driven enforcement (Detection of illegal passenger shipping, Reporting speeding passenger shipping, Detection of noise nuisance on the water and Reporting mooring use passenger shipping).

Matching offender to forensic care location - IFZO (algorithm),Judicial Institutions Department,"The judge imposes forensic care on people who committed a crime from a psychiatric disorder, mental illness or intellectual disability. The judge gives a punishment or measure. DJI carries out that punishment or measure and places litigants with a forensic care provider. This algorithm suggests suitable care providers.",Public Order and Safety,Op https://www.forensischezorg.nl/praktijk/zorgaanbod/locaties staan de locaties van de forensische zorgaanbieders,In use,"There are some difficult terms in this text, we explain them below:Litigants: are all people who are confined at DJI. In this text, we mean all people receiving forensic care.Indication: this is an expert's advice on what kind of care and security an offender needs. On this basis, the best place for an offender is considered.Placement framework: the placement framework contains the agreements made about the placement system. This document is public. It includes, for example, agreements on criteria and contraindications. This allows care providers and litigants to see how placements are made. This is also required by the Forensic Care Act.Criteria: these are the data on litigants that are important for placement. These are the hard criteria. Think gender, age, care needs, etc. These criteria in turn tie in with the indication procedure. For the full list of criteria, see the heading 'Data' in this text. Each healthcare provider has determined the criteria for which it can provide care.Contraindications: these are data that can lead to a different decision than the regular criteria. We also call these the soft criteria. Think of an area ban, incidents, the appropriate institution is full or something else special.Efficient (also called 'effective'): achieving as much as possible with as little effort as possible.Transparent: that it is clear to everyone why you are doing something.Uniform (also called 'uniform'): that it is done the same way every time.There are many care providers and thousands of placements every year. Incidentally, it is not only DJI that does placements. 3RO (three probation organisations) also does placements. In this text, we only talk about DJI's working method.The algorithm suggests the right place with a care provider in an efficient, transparent and uniform manner. This allows the DJI employee to place litigants easily and quickly. This can be at a forensic care provider. This includes a special department in a prison (we call this a Penitentiary Psychiatric Centre or PPC). The agreements from the placement framework are the basis of this algorithm.","The algorithm cannot take everything into account. Therefore, a staff member always evaluates the algorithm's proposal. For the healthcare provider, it is important that the care the litigant needs matches the care the healthcare provider provides.It is very important for an inmate to be placed in the right place to get the right care. There are rules for placing an offender. These rules are:The offender must get the care and security neededThe offender must get the right care on time (think waiting lists)The place where the offender stays must be accessible, including to family, friends and acquaintances (in the right region).An inmate could also be placed without an algorithm. But that is difficult because there are many care providers and many litigants. That is why DJI uses an algorithm. The algorithm makes choosing a care provider more efficient, transparent and uniform. Litigants and care providers are treated equally.",Forensic Care Act article 2.6Judicial and Criminal Records Act article 51a,1.0,,"Heeft u een vraag over dit algoritme? Deze kunt u stellen aan Informatie Rijksoverheid https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/contact/informatie-rijksoverheid.

De Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen is eigenaar van dit algoritme.",nld,,"Below is which data (criteria) the algorithm uses for placements in compulsory and inpatient care. In tbs and inpatient care, an offender is admitted to a care location.The criteria are: Geographical area (e.g. postcode or district), gender, age, some clinical (medically confidential) data: DSM main group, mental capacity, sex offence present, care setting, type of stay, explanation of main diagnosis ''Substance-related disorder''.An offender can also receive outpatient care. Outpatient care is forensic care in which the offender does not (no longer) reside in a clinic. The offender comes to the clinic for treatment and then returns home. If an offender is in a correctional institution, a care provider comes to the prison to treat the offender there.The criteria are: Geographical area (e.g. postal code or district), gender, some clinical (medically confidential) data: dominant care demand, most relevant concomitant problems, nature of care demand, range, need for specific outreach approach/mediation.","The algorithm is a kind of choice diagram (decision tree) and is therefore not self-learning. As a result, the algorithm cannot make choices based on prejudice (bias) or favour certain individuals or care providers.The algorithm suggests a healthcare provider that DJI has a contract with. The algorithm makes a proposal based on the criteria entered by litigants (based on the indication) and compares these with the criteria of care providers. Only care providers that meet all criteria are shown to the employee.There are contraindications that may be important when suggesting a care provider, but are not built into the algorithm. Such as waiting lists or the interests of a victim.","A DJI employee looks at the care providers suggested by the algorithm. The algorithm usually suggests several care providers. The employee then makes a choice according to the placement framework.If there is no care provider that meets the criteria, the algorithm does not suggest a care provider. This is because no suitable care provider has been found in the vicinity of the litigant. If the algorithm cannot find a care provider nearby, the DJI employee asks the algorithm to look outside the region for a suitable care provider. The algorithm then searches again for care providers that can give the offender the required care.A DJI employee may deviate from the algorithm's proposal. However, the staff member must have good reasons for doing so and provide justification. What these reasons might be is listed in the placement framework and we call these contraindications. For example, if the victim lives nearby or if there is a long waiting list. A DJI staff member looks at the situation and chooses the most appropriate care provider for the offender. Because it is important that the offender receives the necessary/appropriate care. An offender is not placed without the intervention of a DJI employee.","The algorithm is in DJI's placement system. That system contains a lot of sensitive data, such as medical data and criminal record data. DJI staff need medically confidential data to be able to place the offender as well as possible. That is why DJI employees receive training in how to handle confidential data. Only employees who have permission to do so can access the placement system and the data it contains.There is a risk that employees work around the algorithm. To prevent this, when deviating from the algorithm's proposal, employees must give reasons why they do so. So it is not possible to place an inmate without the algorithm's proposal.DJI has contracts with care providers of forensic care. These contain the criteria of that care provider. If the criteria are not filled in properly, the placement system may make the wrong choice. It is therefore important that care providers and DJI staff pay close attention when entering the criteria. If necessary, the criteria can be adjusted.The placement system and algorithm must comply with the Baseline Information Security Government (BIO). The BIO sets out the central government's rules for information security. By law, the data used by the algorithm must be kept for 20 years.",This programme was created and is managed by the Judicial ICT Organisation of the Ministry of Justice and Security.,,Judicial Institutions DepartmentDJIHomicideForensic carePrisonerPrisonerPrisonInstitutionOffenderMeasureCriminalMurderPsychiatricPsychologicalJudgePunishmenttbstbs-erinvalidsTerbeschikkingstellingplaced at disposalRapeMental impairmentSex crimeCare provider,,01-2010,,,Other algorithms,"1: Wet Forensische Zorg,  https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940/2021 -07-01. 2: Wet Justitiële en Strafvorderlijke Gegevens, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040634/2024-01-01/0","1: Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). 2: Impact Assessment Mensenrechten en Algoritmes (IAMA), Betreft ethisch gesprek dat is gemodelleerd naar de Impact Assessment Mensenrechten en Algoritmen",,85258929

Advisory tool Grippy,Municipality of Amsterdam,Advice tool Grippy: an application that helps staff in the Entrepreneur Support Department determine whether a business is viable.,Social Security,,Out of use,"The aim of the Gripvol advisory tool is to achieve faster decision-making, cost reduction and greater uniformity in assessing the viability of a company.","In the case of an application for the Besluit bijstandverlening zelfstandigen (Bbz) (Decree on assistance for self-employed persons), a legality check is first carried out. After that, the viability of the business is assessed. A business is viable if there is sufficient income after the assistance (temporary benefit or working capital) to meet all business and private obligations. Assessing viability is labour-intensive and complex. The staff of the Entrepreneur Support Department can investigate viability themselves or outsource this investigation to external contract partners. It is relatively time-consuming to assess it yourself, but an assessment by external contractors is expensive. Therefore, we sought a tool that supports employees in assessing a company's viability. We chose the advice tool Gripvol, which helps structure and support the assessment with financial calculations and industry information. Staff discuss the advice from the tool with the entrepreneur and weigh the advice in the overall assessment of the application Decree on assistance for the self-employed (Bbz). It is not compulsory to use the tool. Employees can use it as one of the tools in their work.",,1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"
Architecture of the model
The advice tool Gripvol uses logic. That is, defined calculations to be performed are compared with the information entered by the employee. The calculations are done on the basis of a decision tree. 
This comparison results in a signal to the employee whether or not there is compliance with the preconditions. Based on this signal, the employee can base his or her decision on the application Decree on assistance for self-employed persons (Bbz).
",,"
Gripvol produces a report based on the input data provided by the client and the employee's assessment. The report is the outcome of this assessment and contains the rationale for whether or not the business is viable. The employee discusses the report with the entrepreneur. In addition, the 4-eye principle applies in the Entrepreneur Support Department. Applications are also assessed by a colleague. 
Employees can use Gripvol, but it is not necessary. They can also handle applications without using Gripvol. The staff member makes the final judgement on a company's viability. The judgement is then assessed by a colleague.
","
Behind the advice tool Gripvol is a model (the decision tree) and it is rule-based. The boundary conditions are not dynamic. They are not adjusted (automatically) in response to entered data. The advice report shows the entered data and the corresponding advice. So it is completely transparent what happens and it can also be explained. Risks in using tool are rated as low.
The advice tool Gripvol is provided by the company Gripvol, which supplies this advice tool to several municipalities. They regularly do so-called 'pen and hack tests', to check that the advice tool cannot be hacked by third parties. The company Gripvol is ISO certified. The municipality of Amsterdam, Entrepreneur Support Department is responsible for processing the data needed to go through the process.

Early on,Municipality of Amsterdam,"In Amsterdam, we fight against poverty. We try to help people at risk of poverty as early as possible to prevent them from getting into serious debt or being evicted.",Social Security,,In use,"In Amsterdam, we fight against poverty. We try to help people at risk of poverty as early as possible to prevent them from getting into serious debt or being evicted. When problems are still small, advice or a light intervention can be enough. To do that, we need to know who is at risk of getting into debt. That is why we receive notifications from health insurers, housing corporations, energy suppliers, water companies and some public authorities, among others, if they have a customer who is in arrears with their payments. This is also called the 'Amsterdam approach to early signalling'. That the creditor may pass this data to the municipality, including personal data, is stated in the Municipal Debt Assistance Act. After the report, the municipality supplements the data with information known to us about the reported person. This is information that is needed to determine whether or not someone is a benefit recipient, a client of WPI (the Werk, Participatie en Inkomen department of the municipality of Amsterdam) and to determine the best care provider to forward the notification to. Supplementing the notification with the information known to the municipality is done automatically, at the press of a button. Someone is always needed to trigger a check for data. The system forwards the notification to a counsellor at the municipality. He or she tries to get in touch with the citizen within 14 days and makes an initial analysis within 28 days. Sometimes there is more at play than arrears. If the citizen accepts help, we make detailed arrangements with him or her. The social worker reports to the central hotline what agreements have been made, so that a creditor knows what the next steps are for the payment arrears.",,,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Creditor notification Creditors make their notification of arrears in a specially developed registration and information system called 'RIS Matching'. The data in this dataset are all data needed to address the right citizen, find the right care provider and provide advice on which help the citizen would benefit most. Only health insurers have a legal basis (Government Gazette 2015) for providing the BSN, the other creditors do not provide a BSN. Data warehouse Poverty Reduction DepartmentAn employee of the municipality links the creditor's report to the data warehouse of the Poverty Reduction Department. Via the data warehouse, information can be retrieved from various databases so that we can determine which social worker can start working with the report. The information is needed not only to link the right social worker to the report, but also for the social worker to start the conversation with the client together with the right client manager.Determining which department will deal with the notification The creditor's notification and the data on the citizen from WPI's data warehouse are then linked. A unique code applies to each department. The code has no function other than to determine whether one is a client or not and which department the notification belongs to.The system can choose from the following codes:Special Target GroupsIntegration and LanguageSocial WorkWork and Training Young peopleWork and ParticipationWork and SafetyLinked dataThe results of linking datasets 1, 2 and 3 are stored in a separate dataset. This dataset therefore contains for each notification the data reported by the creditor, the data added from the data warehouse of the Poverty Reduction Department and the code of a department.Creditor feedbackThe social worker records in the registration and information system (RIS Vroeg Eropaf) whether contact was made with the citizen and whether appointments were made. Creditors can see in the system what has happened to their report. For example, that the report has been processed. The creditor can then stop the direct debit if necessary. Of course, the citizen may refuse help from the municipality. We also register this in the system. The creditor can then decide to restart the collection process.","Architecture of the model The creditor makes a notification in the registration and information system 'RIS Matching'. Once every fortnight, a municipality employee links all new notifications (at the push of a button) to data on the reported person from the Poverty Reduction Department's data warehouse and to data on the various debt assistance programmes available. That link allows the municipality to determine whether it is dealing with the right citizen and which social worker is best placed to contact the citizen. It then checks whether there are multiple debt arrears within one household. Up to this point, the process is automated. Next, there are a few possibilities: In the case of a single payment arrears of less than 250 euros, a text message, letter or e-mail is automatically sent from RIS Matching (depending on which contact details are available). This automated message refers to the website www.amsterdam.nl/geldproblemen . Here, citizens can find debt assistance in their district. If the debt exceeds EUR 250, the notification is automatically forwarded, based on information about the postcode area, to a social worker in the appropriate district or at a WPI department. The social worker tries to contact the citizen within 14 days. The social worker makes an initial analysis within 28 days. Often there is more at play than arrears. If the citizen accepts help, detailed arrangements are made with him or her. If it is not clear from the data whether the person with debts is known to the Poverty Reduction Department, the case is marked as 'unclear' in the system and forwarded to the Vroeg eropaf team. In the exceptional case that a report does not reach a social worker in the right district, the social worker reports this to the RIS Matching system manager. The latter then transfers the report to the correct care worker.","The system makes a number of choices independently (automated), for example to send a text message, email or letter in case of arrears lower than 250 euros, or to which postcode area the notification should be forwarded. During the data linking process, there is one moment of human supervision: the linking of the creditors' notification with the data of the Poverty Reduction Department is automated, but human action is required to start the linking. From the moment the notification is forwarded to the social workers in the appropriate district, the process is no longer automated. The social service provider visits the reported citizen if the citizen does not contact them himself.","The registration and information system called 'RIS Matching' is provided by the company Inforing, a company that supplies this system to 200 municipalities. They regularly carry out so-called 'pen and hack tests' to check that the system cannot be hacked by third parties. They also ensure that personal data is securely managed and not sold to third parties. Security also lies with Inforing. The security meets the BIO standard.Citizens can indicate at any time that they do not want to be listed in the system. The data are then immediately removed. In addition, citizens can access the system at any time. This concerns dataset 4, 'linked data' (see: Data). Other rules apply to the data in the data warehouse of the Poverty Reduction Department, namely the Urban Framework for Processing Personal Data and the General Data Protection Regulation. The data warehouse and debt arrears reports are two separate systems and debt arrears reports do not enter the data warehouse. The moment the municipality has to remove the data from the RIS Matching system, no debt arrears information remains with the municipality.

Print image (NL),Municipality of Amsterdam,"Busy Image is a web app, which gives a picture of the current busyness in the city by bringing together different sources of information. ","Space and Infrastructure, Economy",,In use,"Crowding in public spaces has been a problem in Amsterdam for years. Since the corona pandemic, it has only become more important to have a good picture of how busy the city is. Druktebeeld is a web app, which gives a picture of the current busyness in the city by bringing together different sources of information. It shows, for example, how many visitors are at a location or which parking spaces are in use. To get this picture, we use visitors' location data via, for example, the Weatheronline web app.Busy image is intended to inform the public about how busy public spaces are. People can see how busy it is somewhere, and then choose to go there at a quieter time, or take a different route. Moreover, Druktebeeld helps the municipality manage crowds when necessary.Equity and justiceDruktebeeld's models deal only with numbers of people and cars, not personal characteristics.We examined the input data for the transient model (CMSA counts). This showed no bias based on race or gender. The algorithm is trained with a variety of images without considering the race or gender of the people in those images. The algorithm only counts the number of heads.The input data of the display model (Resono counts) are based on GPS locations of an app user group. Thus, only locations of people present are used. This will give a bias in the counts, especially by country of origin, but possibly also, for example, by gender or age. As these person characteristics are not collected by Resono, we cannot say exactly how big an effect this has. MAC addresses are not used.When we started developing the web app, we asked stakeholders (members of the public and municipal employees) about their needs. Stakeholders can also participate by indicating in the webapp whether the crowding indication reflects their own experience/interpretation of crowding. In addition, we have developed a separate channel for the municipality's crowd management team to send us more extensive feedback.The results of the models can be viewed in the Pressure Image web app. This app is not yet fully suitable for disabilities such as colour blindness and illiteracy, and is only available in Dutch.",,,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"CMSAThe Crowd Monitoring System Amsterdam (CMSA) provides information on the number of passers-by at a number of busy spots in the city.

The purpose of the models is to translate a value into a crowding indicator: 	*not busy: easy to keep 1.5m distance/sufficient parking spaces (colour green) 	*pressure: possible to keep 1.5m distance / few available parking spaces (colour orange) 	*too busy: difficult/not possible to keep 1.5m distance / (almost) no available parking spaces (colour red) *Pressure is somewhat subjective. The aim is to show the average crowding of app users via the colours in Busy Image. When the 1.5m measure was abolished, we adjusted the definitions of the colours. We use user feedback when setting pressure thresholds (not directly when users provide feedback). The models create two threshold values per location: low-pressure threshold and high-pressure threshold. These values are calculated and stored every few weeks (Resono) or months (CMSA &amp; parking). If the count at a location, at a given time is: 	*Under pressure threshold low, a location will be marked 'not busy'. 	*Between pressure threshold low and pressure threshold high, it gets the indication 'busy'.	*Over crowd threshold high, it gets the indication 'too busy'. 	*These pressure indications are calculated every 15 minutes for each location (from each source) and displayed in the Pressure Image web app. Passer-by model (CMSA)The purpose of this model is to create thresholds for the number of people passing a sensor. Pressure thresholds are calculated directly based on the width of the street where the sensor is located. For some locations, the municipality's crowd management team can adjust the values based on visitor feedback. Impression model (Resono)*The purpose of this model is to calculate thresholds to estimate how many people are in a given area. The model is a decision tree with the following inputs: 	*historical Resono data; 	*type of location (park/square/shopping street); 	*area (square metres of the park/square/shopping street); 	*length of paths within the area (collected using OpenStreetMap);	*feedback from web app users; and 	*feedback from the municipality's crowd management team. *The resulting pressure thresholds obviously vary by location.Parking modelUsing past pressure data, we can give an indication of how likely a location is to become full at the time the user checks Pressure View. The pressure data also gives an indication of whether there is sufficient time between the moment a user checks Pressure Image and the moment he arrives at the parking location and finds a spot. The occupancy rate is determined on the basis of: 	*the available spaces; 	*The total capacity per garage as the difference between the total number of available spaces; and 	*the available spaces of the past 5 quarters. 	*At present, we only use information on short-stay parking. Thresholds are determined for each location by analysing historical data. For most locations, the pressure threshold 'low' is set at 90 per cent occupancy. Below this percentage, there are sufficient spaces. For these locations, the pressure threshold 'high' is set at 95 per cent. Between 90 per cent and 95 per cent, there are sufficient places available, but they are likely to be full within 30 minutes. For some locations, spaces may fill up faster. At those locations, the 'low' and 'high' thresholds are 80 per cent and 90 per cent respectively. Crowding expectations for metro stopsWe make a crowd forecast for the coming week at metro stops. To do this, we use past check-in and check-out data, weather data and the weather forecast. The threshold values are set for each stop depending on their surface area. The crowding forecast is determined based on: 	*Number of check-ins and check-outs last year 	*Surface area of the metro stop	*Weather data last week	*Weather forecast next week","Human-in-command.No automated decisions are made based on Druktebeeld's models. Every decision based on crowding is made by humans, which can be either officials or citizens, with support from the Druktebeeld data and web app. From the 'pass-by' and 'impression' models come mass indications. These are monitored by issuing a report every few weeks. This report evaluates the input data, user feedback on the crowd indications and feedback from the crowd management team on the crowd indications. The report includes tables and graphs with data and results that appear unexpected/irregular. Following the results of the report, the models are adjusted as necessary.","The risks identified are: 1.Decision is taken on incorrect indication of crowds. There may be differences between presented (modelled) and observed (actual) crowds. As a result, someone may:avoided a location/route because it was (too) crowded, when it was not;use a location/route assuming it was not (too) busy, when it was.Thresholds are continuously evaluated to ensure that users have the best possible indication of crowding. In this evaluation, we also take users' feedback into account.2.Residents/visitors feel they are being watched by the municipality. When using the web app, people may feel that they are being watched, because of all the data on crowding that is apparently available.By using the app, people may also feel they are being followed. But their location is collected and stored only if they want to give feedback and consent to share their location data. This location data is linked to an id, not personal information.There is a clear opt-in that appears only when you yourself click the option to share your location or give feedback. It is not forced on you by a push-notification or pop-up and does not appear automatically, as with many other websites.All data we receive for the Print Image models are aggregate counts. There are privacy measures in place by the parties providing the data. They also do not receive personal data such as gender, age and residential address.3.Unintended use of the information. We show crowds, including actual numbers of pedestrians. This can be used in ways the developers did not intend. For example, people might look for crowded places instead of avoiding them. Pickpockets could use the app to look up crowded locations.By not showing actual numbers, we can mitigate these risks. This is still under discussion.4.The municipality has not independently verified that the data obtained by Resono is fully anonymised.

To clarify whether additional support is needed, the Maatwerkscan uses various data. Much of this data is in our systems and thus already known to UWV. The algorithm also uses information you provided when you applied for your WW benefit. The Maatwerkscan uses the following data:

whether you have previously received social assistance benefit
the total number of months you are entitled to WW benefit
the number of months you will still receive unemployment benefit
the amount of your WW benefit
whether you have any income on top of your WW benefit
whether you receive a supplement to your WW benefit
your age on the first day of your WW benefit
the composition of your household (single, cohabiting)

","
From the Maatwerkscan comes a score. This score gives us information about the risk of you having to apply for social assistance benefit after the WW. The higher the score, the higher this risk.

The Maatwerkscan is carried out again every week. Here, some data remain the same, but there are also data that always change. For example, the number of months you will still get WW gets smaller and smaller. As a result, the risk of being on welfare becomes slightly higher each time. It is therefore possible that we will not contact you until you have been on WW benefit for a bit longer.

Have you not yet been invited for an interview, but would like advice? You can always request an interview. UWV helps everyone on WW benefit, regardless of the results of the Maatwerkscan.
","
The algorithm helps us to be able to see if you could use extra support. But ultimately the UWV employee decides whether we contact you. Furthermore, we monitor the use of the algorithm in the following ways:

Our specialists check every week whether the algorithm gives the correct (logical) results.
Are you invited for an interview? Then a UWV employee reviews with you what is needed to find work. The algorithm does not determine this.
Our staff can always decide to offer more customisation. Even if the Maatwerkscan gives a low score.
Our staff judge for themselves whether we offer you extra guidance. The algorithm does not determine this. You are also free to reject our assistance.

","
We ensure that we remain compliant with information security and privacy requirements. We do this in the following ways:

We do not use the results of the Customisation Scan for other purposes.
We continuously work on maintaining the algorithm.
We have other organisations check our compliance with legal and ethical standards.
An external and independent organisation carries out quality checks to test whether the algorithm is careful. This is in addition to the checks our specialist UWV staff do as standard.



Customisation scan is designed so that everyone looking for work is treated in the same way. This is done as follows:

Maatwerkscan processes all data in the same way.
Maatwerkscan does not use personal characteristics such as origin, gender or nationality.

Anonymisation software,Province of Drenthe,"The algorithm underlines personal data in documents. An employee has to look at all pages and check whether the document is properly anonymised. Then the software removes all highlighted information and blacklists it. After that, the documents can be published, for example under the Open Government Act.",Law,,In use,"The anonymisation software is deployed to anonymise documents published by the province faster and better. This way, we prevent data leaks and contribute to better protection of data subjects' AVG rights.","The province increasingly needs to make information public. Therefore, privacy- or business-sensitive information has to be lacquered out. Before the algorithm was deployed, this deleting did not always go well. There were data breaches where not all personal data was deleted or where deleted information could still be read. The advantage of anonymisation software is that anonymisation is faster and better. The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server. The content is not stored on this server, so the privacy risk of using the algorithm does not outweigh the privacy benefit of reducing the number of data breaches due to improper anonymisation.",1. WOO 2. WCO 3. UAVG 4. WEP 5. WDO,1.0,,post@drenthe.nl,nld,,"All information found in the uploaded documents (except metadata) is processed by the algorithm. This may include ordinary personal data, special personal data and criminal data. It may also include business-sensitive information.","Documents are uploaded to the application by an employee. At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8. Minimum key figures for the accuracy of identifying personal data are as follows: Named entities (precision): 0.78, Named entities (recall): 0.76, Named entities (F-score): 0.77.Finally, a staff member checks the document and when it completes the document, the data to be anonymised is permanently removed from the text layer and a black bar is placed.",The outcome of the algorithm is checked by an employee. The clerk is required by the software to check all pages. The clerk determines whether the document is correctly anonymised.,"There is no risk of automated decision-making and the algorithm has no impact on fundamental rights because the algorithm does not make decisions with legal consequences. It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists.The province's employee always does the final test of whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm.The last risk that remains is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

A dangerous traffic situation, housing nuisance or nuisance from people and the hospitality industry can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report best fitted into (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality. But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, it was sometimes difficult to find the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. Based on this, it determines which category the report best fits and which department should handle it. So the caller no longer has to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right department.",,,1.0,,gemeente@aaenhunze.nl,nld,,"NotificationsThe dataset consists of notifications made previously.

Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight.From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to fit.","All reports that can be categorised with less than 40% certainty are forwarded to the Customer Contact Centre under the heading ""other"". A human assessment then takes place and the call is still categorised. Reports that are wrongly forwarded to an incorrect category are also manually placed in the correct category by the department responsible (sometimes via the Customer Contact Centre).","There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. Employees at the Customer Contact Centre review those reports and manually put them in the right category.

If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,zeist@zeist.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor.

However, if additional data, checks or actions are required, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There, it is checked by a civil affairs employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve an application/declaration. Only the civil affairs officer can reject an application/declaration.The impact is that such an application can be dealt with efficiently by the municipality; after all, a resident/company has already completed several steps (work), leaving the official more time for the special and/or complicated declarations/applications the municipality receives. In some cases, this application can even be processed fully automatically.

AERIUS Calculator is the 'calculator' with which the nitrogen deposition contribution of a plan or project can be made transparent, AERIUS Monitor provides information about the total nitrogen load on protected nature areas and the origin of this deposition, AERIUS Register enables competent authorities to allocate nitrogen deposition space to new permits via nitrogen banks, and AERIUS Check serves to support subsidy schemes, such as the peak load approach.When consent is granted, AERIUS Calculator serves as a starting point to determine whether a plan or project may have a significant impact on nitrogen-sensitive habitats in Natura 2000 areas. The calculation results from AERIUS Calculator are included in the further assessment of the effects in granting permission.AERIUS Monitor shows the figures calculated by RIVM on total deposition and exceedance of the KDW. This monitoring information is used to draw up new policy or adjust existing policy. The figures provide insight into the effort required and tools for specifying, for instance, sectors or locations.","AERIUS Calculator is designed to make the complexity of dispersion modelling accessible to a wide audience. The tool provides a low-threshold interface in which a user can enter an activity itself. To perform the calculation, AERIUS Calculator calls underlying data and calculation models.

These scientific models are managed and continuously developed by RIVM for use in AERIUS, among others. The models are also used in other dossiers, such as air quality.Using calculation models to determine nitrogen deposition as a result of a plan or project is necessary because the effect of future activities cannot be measured. To approach reality as closely as possible with the model calculation, the most up-to-date scientific knowledge is used in the calculation models.

The municipality uses a programme from the supplier Dariuz for this purpose.Wage value determination involves determining how valuable an employee's work is with an employer. In order to determine the wage value, we first look at the employee's main tasks. It then looks at the performance required to perform a main task. Once calculated, the wage value is rounded to whole percentages. Article 6 of the Participation Act describes exactly how a wage value measurement works. The UWV may indicate that an employee is in the target group register. The UWV may also suspect reduced wage value, seen from the employer, employee or a work coach involved. The work coach is employed by the municipality. A wage value expert plays an important role in wage value determination. This expert determines the content of a standard job, sets the performance per main task, calculates the total, records all this in a report. The municipal executive determines the quality requirements a wage-value expert must meet. The wage valuation expert functions independently. The wage-value expert performs the wage-value measurement. Usually, a wage-value expert is specially trained for this purpose. He or she looks at the time the employee needs to perform the tasks, the pace of work, the quality of the work completed, and what the net working time is. Furthermore, the employee, employer and, in some cases, the work coach complete a questionnaire. All the collecting data are entered into Dariuz. Based on this, a recommendation for the wage value comes out of Dariuz. The work coach ultimately takes the decision on the level of the wage value. The employee receives a letter about this. An employee can always object to this decision.

This tool is used to render sensitive data unrecognisable in the process.,Organisation and business operations,Anonimiseren - xxllnc,In use,"The anonymisation tool is used to ensure transparency while protecting individuals, companies and institutions.The tool allows organisations to share information according to regulations such as the Woo, both actively and passively. This helps in protecting personal data of data subjects. The same goes for protecting privacy data of the organisation's own employees.Applicants of a Woo request will receive the requested information, anonymised or partially masked according to other regulations. For the departments responsible for handling Woo requests, the tool makes complying with laws and regulations easier and shortens turnaround time so that information can be offered within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low for individuals and organisations. The algorithm searches for (personal) data and flags or masks it, without making automatic decisions. A task expert evaluates the proposals for anonymisation.The tool also offers the option to manually mask information that cannot be disclosed, such as strategic information to protect the organisation or partners. The basis for anonymising or masking is provided by the tool.","Sometimes certain excerpts of text in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo provides bases for this, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG).Without tools, anonymising texts would be time-consuming and increase the risk of errors, which could lead to unwanted publication of sensitive data. Using an anonymisation tool speeds up and simplifies this process for both active and passive disclosure.Automated anonymisation is less error-prone than manual work.

Zivver,Municipality of Bergen (L),This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,info@bergen.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor. If it turns out that the algorithm is making incorrect classifications more often, this is picked up by the monitoring so that adjustments to the algorithm can be made.

Detection of noise pollution on the water:In Amsterdam, there are many reports of noise pollution on the water. Waterway inspectors can impose fines when noise nuisance is detected in the act. To support enforcement, sensors have been installed that register noise volume and movement on the water. The algorithm identifies potential noise nuisance based on three criteria: noise volume from the water is above a threshold, higher noise volume than from the shore and simultaneous movement from a vessel. When these criteria apply, an incident of potential noise nuisance is recorded. The recorded incidents can be used to gain insight into hotspots of structural nuisance locations. Based on this information, fairway inspectors can visit and monitor a location.

Detection of illegal passenger shipping: In 2020, the municipality of Amsterdam started developing a report to detect illegal passenger shipping. In Amsterdam, passenger shipping is regulated by a permit. Vessels carrying passengers without a licence constitute unfair competition for licensed passenger vessels and are associated with nuisance on the water. The report provides a weekly overview of pleasure craft that regularly sailed the same route in the past week. This insight comes from the mandatory vignettes for pleasure craft. The passage of vessels with vignettes can be measured as vessels pass by at a short distance from a sensor. The algorithm consists of a calculation rule, which determines which vignettes sail the same round several days a week, more than once a day. The aim is to help fairway inspectors detect illegal pleasure craft by identifying hotspots and frequently used routes. Enforcement occurs only in the act and only by an authorised fairway inspector, there is no enforcement based on automatic decision-making or remote interventions.","

Performance is declared before the invoice is paid, unless otherwise specified in the contract or the requirement for the PV.The recording of performance certificates is done in the Leonardo financial information system. If this is not possible (e.g. due to the AVG or confidential procurement), the delivery can be explained in writing by other means, such as via the text field on the receipt entry or by an alternative receipt (type 2).For some time, the Ministry of Justice and Security (JenV) has had a finding from the Audit Department Rijk (ADR) and the Algemene Rekenkamer (AR) on the consistent (and later qualitative) recording of attachments in financial records (Leonardo). Financial Control (FC) has taken up this finding. Because there are many payments requiring a performance statement, checking these manually is not feasible. Current sampling selects a-select items, which includes checking good performance statements. This can be improved by doing risk-based sampling.A model has been developed to improve the capture of performance statements and quality control.

Public space reports,Municipality of Meierijstad,"If something needs to be fixed or cleaned up on the street or in a park, it can be reported to the municipality through Signals, the open source notification system of for and by municipalities.",Public Order and Safety,www.meierijstad.nl,In use,"If something needs to be fixed or cleaned up on the street or in a park, it can be reported to the municipality through Signalen, the open source reporting system of for and by municipalities. A dangerous traffic situation, housing nuisance or nuisance from people and the hospitality industry can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report best fitted with (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality.But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, people did not always choose the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. On this basis, it determines which category the report best fits and which department should handle it. So the caller no longer needs to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right department.",,,1.0,,privacy@meierijstad.nl,nld,,"NotificationsThe dataset consists of notifications made previously (free text field) to train the algorithm. It is regularly retrained with new reports and implemented corrections to existing reports. If departments see an incorrect categorisation, (see Human supervision) they correct it manually in the notification system. These corrections are used in re-training. We are investigating whether re-training the algorithm can be automated in the future.We cannot disclose this dataset in this register. Because the data comes from a free text field, it may contain personal data, although it is not explicitly requested.E-mail address and phone number for follow-up questionsSomeone making a report can leave their phone number and/or e-mail address if they want. We then keep the reporter informed of the progress and we have the option to call him or her back.

Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight.From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to fit.",All reports categorised with less than 40% certainty are forwarded to planning field service. A human assessment then takes place and the call is still categorised. Calls that are wrongly assigned to the wrong category are also manually assigned to the correct category by the department responsible.,"There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. Public area management staff review those reports and manually put them in the right category. So if the algorithm does not work properly, it takes a little longer for the report to reach the right department. The reporter can add personal data if he or she wants to be kept informed. This data is stored securely and not used by the algorithm.",,,Reports Complaints Natural language processing,,11-2024,,,Other algorithms,,,,26519744
National Approach to Address Quality (LAA),Municipality of Amsterdam,The aim of LAA is to improve the quality of address data in the Basic Register of Persons so that public bodies can perform their public duties based on accurate information.,,https://www.rvig.nl/landelijke-aanpak-adreskwaliteit-laa ,In use,"The aim of LAA is to improve the quality of address data in the Basic Registration of Persons so that public bodies can perform their public tasks based on accurate information. This is done by analysing personal data using risk profiles. The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations processes the data.   If, after investigation, the registration is found to be incorrect, the municipality notifies the citizen in writing. A formal process then follows: the address investigation. Citizens are asked to report their change of address as soon as possible. If the municipality has found out the correct address then the municipality will move the citizen to this address. If the municipality has not been able to trace an address, the citizen will be deregistered from the BRP. It is then unknown where the citizen resides and the municipality registers in the system that the address is unknown.   If an investigation into registration of persons at the address is going to take place, home visits will be made to the address, possibly compromising personal privacy. ","The accuracy of (address) data in the BRP is essential for the functioning of the Dutch government. A government that does not know or does not know how to find its citizens is unable to perform the tasks entrusted to it by its citizens. In many cases, it is a precondition for the correct implementation of legal regulations and for the effectiveness of government policies. For citizens, proper registration is important for their correspondence with the government and for claiming address-related government services.  The algorithm ensures efficient and most effective finding of addresses where there is a high probability of incorrect address registrations. Using the algorithm, you can prioritise addresses where the probability of incorrect registration is greater than 50 per cent while ensuring that you do not unnecessarily visit citizens' doors. If an address meets the algorithm's selection criteria, the address is shared with a municipality. Following the signal, the municipality may decide to launch an address investigation. This may include a home visit by the municipality. Selection of a high-risk address does not automatically lead to an adjustment of the address data in the BRP. It can only do so if the municipality sees reason to do so after conducting its own investigation. There is no automatic decision-making in this algorithm. There is always human intervention by the municipality's official and the LAA partnership, which consists of signal providers, RvIG, the VNG and the NVVB. The decision of a municipality to change the address data in the BRP can be objected to. ",BRP Act,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2018/05/16/landelijke-aanpak-adreskwaliteit-gegevensbeschermingseffectbeoordeling  ,"The data from the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) such as number of people registered at an address and the data from the Basic Registration of Addresses and Buildings (BAG) such as living area per address and the function and status of the address. Regulations state which data we are allowed to use in the algorithm. Data that is not mentioned is therefore not allowed to be used. Nor do we use (personal) data that could lead to discrimination. We do not select on nationality, place of birth or derivatives thereof. ","A profile consists of one or more selection factors that select address data of a person. The selection factors, taken together, can lead to doubts about the accuracy of these address details. This methodology is consistent with the methodology developed in the LAA project phase. The algorithms used to select addresses in the project phase all have the character of simple, transparent, decision trees (rule-based) with a limited number of selection factors and thresholds. LAA's approach does not involve a system making autonomous, unpredictable or uncontrollable decisions or adjusting the algorithms independently, without human intervention. The algorithms assume correlation between the presence of the predetermined selection factors, on the one hand, and an increased probability of incorrect registration in the BRP, on the other. This means that the algorithm selects addresses that meet certain characteristics (selection factors). This is based on the (statistical) correlation between the presence of the selection factors and an increased probability of incorrect registration, without there having to be a causal relationship between the two. After all, a high correlation means that both phenomena (the selection factor and incorrect registration) occur relatively often together, but not that one is necessarily the cause of the other. The minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations will continue this way of working when carrying out his support task. Each LAA signal will still be manually assessed by an employee of the Quality Department before any follow-up action is taken.  ","The Quality Department investigates the reports. Each signal is assessed manually/independently. The department assesses independently/manually whether further investigation is necessary. Criteria depend on the signal. After assessment, the file is further built with relevant information. The selection is done by an employee trained for this purpose. The employee knows the background of the signal and is specialised in conducting address research. Only when it is established that the actual situation does not correspond to the administrative reality, the municipality starts an official address investigation in which a signal goes to all buyers who are obliged to use the BRP. From then on, it may have consequences for the public services that the citizen uses. ","Privacy is potentially compromised, through the processing of personal data and home visits by municipalities.  The signals are provided by (RVIG). The RVIG tests whether all signals are compliant.The system (LAA Monitor) where data is exchanged meets all municipal security requirements. Data are exchanged via eHerkenning (https://www.eherkenning.nl/nl).There is no automated decision-making. Each signal investigated is assessed manually. If signals are older than 6 months, they are removed from the LAA Monitor. If an LAA investigation reveals incorrect data, an official address investigation follows (signal category 08 listed on the citizen's personal record). The complete file (report from the LAA monitor) is then part of the official address investigation. This investigation is kept for 10 years (legal retention period for address investigations).",,,"Overcrowding, Basic Registration of Persons, BRP, Basic Registration, Removal, registration, postal address, address search, investigation, home visit",,,,,Impactful algorithms,"1: Ministeriele regeling LAA, https://rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/regelingen/2023/05/01/ministeriele-regeling-landelijke-aanpak-adreskwaliteit-laa","1: Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), https://www.amsterdam.nl/privacy/specifieke/privacyverklaringen-burgerzaken-contact/adresonderzoek-basisinformatie/",,27677810

Signal Costumers,Stichting Inlichtingenbureau,Is a house shared by several adults? Then the assistance benefit may change. This is because housing costs can then be shared. But not all housemates count towards the benefit.

This is about who lives in the home of the person receiving assistance. If someone in the house meets certain characteristics (such as age and studies), there may be housing costs (such as rent/mortgage or energy etc.) to be shared. This affects the amount of the benefit. The information on who lives in the household comes from the Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (RvIG), and study information comes from the Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs (DUO).The purpose of this service is to give municipalities insight into changes at the address of people on welfare benefits or supplementary incomplete old-age pension (AOW) benefits. This is important because these changes can affect the cost-sharing standard and thus the amount of the benefit. The Intelligence Agency passes on information about these changes to municipalities. This allows municipalities to better determine whether there is a cost-sharing or joint household. This allows them, if necessary, to adjust the benefit in time to the new situation. It also allows municipalities to check whether the person on benefits has reported the change in address to the municipality, or whether this is new information.","The 'signal cost commuters' is part of the information service 'Samenloopsignalering'. See also algorithm 'Samenloopsignalering' which answers the general questions for this service.This description only deals with the specific points of the 'Signal cost commuters'.The algorithm ensures that municipalities only receive data from their own residents with social assistance benefits and where a change has occurred that may affect the cost-sharing standard.

Only the points belonging to 'Signal start Income relationship' are discussed here (see SUWI data register for the definition of Income relationship (link: https://sgr.bkwi.nl/sgr/Report%20HTML%20SGR18.0.htm).A person on benefits must self-report any changes that may affect the right to or amount of benefits. This applies, for example, to income from work, pension or other benefits. This income is then taken into account. The municipality must check that a person on social assistance benefits has no new income that has not (yet) been reported. The Social Insurance Bank (SVB) must also check this for supplementary income provision for the elderly (AIO).Instead of always doing their own research, municipalities can receive information from the Inlichtingenbureau when there is a new income. This allows them to engage with their residents if there is unknown income.The algorithm ensures that a municipality only receives data on residents with social assistance benefits and a signal on new income. This keeps residents' privacy protected. Another advantage is that the algorithm works faster and more efficiently than if the municipality had to do this itself.

Thus, municipalities receive information if someone has income while receiving social assistance benefits. Box 1 income is, for example, income from self-employment, alimony or income from work such as freelancing, childcare or a newspaper round.Based on the tax return, it shows whether a person had box 1 income while on welfare.

For this purpose, the 'Concurrence Signalling' algorithm has been prepared that answers the general issues for this service.In this algorithm, only the specific points belonging to 'Signal Income Box 1' are explained. Income can affect the right and amount of a benefit. The Intelligence Bureau uses data from the Tax and Customs Administration to check whether there is a concurrence of income and benefit, in order to verify whether the benefit is justified and correct.By 'concurrence', we mean that a current benefit coincides with the tax year in which the box 1 income was received. The Box 1 indication is about the types of income that were there in that year.Information from the income tax return may not be known until later in the year. Or it may sometimes be adjusted during the year. Because this information can affect the right or amount of a benefit, a monthly check is made to see if there are any changes in this data. This way, any changes can be detected quickly.The algorithm ensures that the municipality only receives the data of residents on welfare benefits who have income in Box 1. In this way, we protect residents' privacy. An advantage of this algorithm is that it works much faster than manually checking what income a resident has.

Detect risks in customs declarations for opium law waiver compliance,Customs,This algorithm helps Customs to select goods for inspection based on risk. It uses declaration data from companies and looks at whether or not there are increased risks of importing and exporting opium act drugs for which an exemption has been granted.,Public Order and Safety,https://www.belastingdienst.nl/bibliotheek/handboeken/html/boeken/HVGEM/opiumwet.html,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to more efficiently select which declarations are potentially risk-sensitive under the Opium Act . This algorithm focuses on Opium Act drugs and looks at declarations of goods entering or leaving the territory of the Netherlands from outside the European Union. It uses declaration data from companies and considers whether or not there are risks of import and export of Opium Act drugs for which an exemption has been granted. Based on the results, Customs checks companies more or just less. By using this algorithm, declarations are processed more efficiently, resulting in declarations being checked faster and possibly released faster.","Customs processes 700 million declarations annually, including in the field of opiates. With this algorithm (risk profiles), Customs can assess declarations more efficiently and faster than without using this algorithm. Thus, declarations are approved or checked faster. And goods are released faster. Also, the algorithm ensures that 'known and reliable' companies are actually checked less.","Legal basis for controls on opiates lies in the Union Customs Code (DWU), the General Customs Act and the Opium Act. These laws ensure that the import and export of opiates is done properly. The use of risk profiles also relies on DWU section 46. This says that customs controls should mainly rely on risk analysis by electronic data processing techniques.",1.0,,algoritmeregister@douane.nl,nld,,"The algorithm uses data from the goods declaration. For example, type of goods, commodity code, document code, weight, number of packages, consignee, declarant, consignor, country of consignment, EORI number, means of transport, etc.","The algorithm consists of decision rules created in collaboration with content experts. These decision rules provide estimates of which declarations have a higher risk of importing and exporting opiates without a waiver. These decision rules are based on 'if-then-else' combinations. An example: if (if) the information we have on a shipment shows that the goods have an abnormal weight, (then) the declaration is checked manually and the shipment may be selected for extended inspection. If the goods do not have an abnormal weight (else), we do not stop the shipment. Or at least not based on this criterion.","If a declaration produces a match with a risk profile, a customs officer reviews the declaration. If necessary, the customs officer asks for more information. The decision to approve a declaration, or instead to start checking, is made by a human being.","A risk profile is always developed and checked by at least two customs staff before use.

Detect risks in customs declarations on imports of GPS and GSM jammers,Customs,This algorithm helps Customs to select goods for inspection based on risk. It uses declaration data from companies and considers whether or not there are risks of non-compliant or dangerous devices (GPS and GSM jammers) or fixed installations and radio equipment entering the European Union through the Netherlands.,Public Order and Safety,https://www.belastingdienst.nl/bibliotheek/handboeken/html/boeken/HVGEM/productveiligheid.html   ,In use,"This algorithm focuses on declarations of goods entering the European Union through the territory of the Netherlands. The algorithm focuses on Customs control of whether non-compliant or dangerous devices (GPS and GSM jammers) or fixed installations and radio equipment are introduced into the Netherlands. Regulation 765/2008 (product safety) provides a basis for setting up EU market surveillance and control of products entering the Union. In this, Customs acts in cooperation with the Radiocommunications Agency. Customs checks companies more or less based on the results. By using this algorithm, declarations are handled more efficiently, resulting in quicker checks and possibly quicker releases.","Customs processes 700 million declarations every year, including in the field of product safety. With this algorithm (risk profiles), Customs can assess declarations more efficiently and faster than without using this algorithm. Thus, declarations are approved or checked faster. And goods are released faster. Also, the algorithm ensures that 'known and reliable' companies are actually checked less.","Legal basis for product safety controls is in the Union Customs Code (DWU), the General Customs Act, Regulation 765/2008, Telecommunications Act and Economic Offences Act. The use of risk profiles also relies on DWU Article 46. This says customs controls must rely primarily on risk analysis by electronic data processing techniques.",1.0,,algoritmeregister@douane.nl,nld,,"The algorithm uses all data from the goods declaration.

These decision rules provide estimates of which declarations have a higher risk of bringing in non-compliant or dangerous devices (GPS and GSM jammers) or fixed installations and radio equipment . These decision rules are based on 'if-then-else' combinations. An example: if (if) the information we have on a shipment shows that the goods have an abnormal weight, (then) the declaration is checked manually and the shipment may be selected for extended inspection. If the goods do not have an abnormal weight (else), we do not stop the shipment.

Parking control,Municipality of Amsterdam,"To keep Amsterdam liveable and accessible, only a limited number of cars are allowed to park in the city. ","Economy, Space and Infrastructure",,In use,"To keep Amsterdam liveable and accessible, only a limited number of cars are allowed to park in the city. The municipality checks whether a parked car has the right to be parked, i.e. whether someone has paid a parking fee or has a parking permit. To work more efficiently, we do this check with scanning cars. With these, we currently check more than 190,000 official parking spaces in Amsterdam.The scan cars are equipped with cameras and drive past parking spaces in the city. The cameras capture car license plates and use an image recognition algorithm to identify license plates.Any bystanders, unrelated license plates and other privacy-sensitive data are rendered unrecognisable on the images already in the scanning car.The license plate number is sent to the National Parking Register where it is checked whether the car has the right to be parked. If a person is found not to have paid a parking fee, an inspector uses ambient photos to assess whether there is a special situation (loading or unloading, stationary cars in front of a traffic light). If in doubt, a parking inspector reviews the situation on the spot. If there is no special situation, a parking ticket ('additional parking tax assessment') follows.Increasing the chance of being caught increases fairness towards those who do pay or have a valid parking permit. Enforcing the offence of 'standing still on the pavement' reduces nuisance and increases liveability for those who do pay or have a valid parking permit.",,,1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Scanned license plates Scan cars with automated license plate recognition drive around the city to recognise license plates of parked cars. The data processed by the scan cars are the scanned images of number plates, along with the location of the car and time stamp data. If parking fees have been paid, the data is anonymised after 48 hours (license plate images and surrounding photos are deleted; the license plate is removed from the metadata). If no parking fee has been paid, data is kept for as long as necessary for objection and appeal. National Parking Register (NPR) The National Parking Register is a national database recording all current parking entitlements of license plates. The register is managed by the RDW. The data is collected from parking meters and parking apps of municipal and commercial parking companies, parking providers and enforcers. Data on parking rights are kept in the register for 13 weeks after the parking right ends (accessible only to authorised personnel). Registry data is used to check whether someone is allowed to park somewhere.","Algorithms are used:to locate the number plate in the camera images;to adjust the images for identification;to identify the individual characters of the number plate and;to make possible bystanders, unrelated licence plates and other privacy-sensitive information unrecognisable in those imagesOnce a number plate is identified and processed, the license plate data is sent to the National Parking Registry for further processing. An NPR algorithm then checks the validity of parking rights for the license plate at a given time and location (for information on that algorithm, see the information on NPR's website: https://nationaalparkeerregister.nl/downloads/downloads-mobiel-parkeren.html - in particular the technical documentation). A positive result means that the car has valid parking rights. In that case, the scan data of the number plate is deleted within 48 hours. In case of a negative result, the images are checked by an employee of parking company P1, which carries out parking checks on behalf of the municipality of Amsterdam. Parking company P1 assesses whether there is a special situation, such as loading and unloading or a traffic light. If in doubt, a parking inspector looks at the situation on the spot. If a license plate has no valid parking rights, the data is transferred to the municipal tax authority. They use the RDW's database to link the license plate to the owner's personal data and send a parking ticket ('parking tax fine').The scan car is used for data collection on parking pressure and the type of permit holder in addition to controlling paid parking and enforcing standing on the pavement.","Human controllers review the images to see if there is a special situation, for example loading or unloading, or stationary cars at a traffic light. They also check whether licence plate number is read correctly. If in doubt, a parking controller reviews the situation on the spot.","The system has low risk. The main risk is that the system misrecognises a license plate number and someone gets fined who does not deserve it.This can happen if a letter or digit on the license plate is wrongly recognised by both the algorithm and the controller. To manage this risk, people are given the option to submit written objections within six weeks via a website (naheffingsaanslag.amsterdam.nl).

Cryptshare,Municipality of Gennep,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,gemeente@gennep.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is flagged as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor.

The information demand Number of residents at address,National Authority for Identity Data,This algorithm is used to display on MijnOverheid the number of residents at the logged-in person's residential address.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of the algorithm is to provide targeted information to organisations using the BRP (users), rather than loose data that users have to process into information themselves. The algorithm converts the loose data into information, based on rules. That information is provided to users from the central BRP, rather than the entire set of data needed to arrive at that information. As a result, less data is provided to BRP users; this achieves data minimisation.In addition to data minimisation, the deployment of algorithms in the BRP APIs has the following objectives.Preventing errors in the use of BRP data, such as incorrect derivation of the acquisition name based on separate name data, so that citizens' rights are protected as much as possible.More transparency for citizens; citizens can also see how the data has been used because the derivation rules are public (the derivation rules used by BRP users themselves are mostly not known and, moreover, differ from one user to another).Long-term cost savings:because BRP users no longer have to manage copy files;lower connection costs to the BRP for users;centralisation of rules at the provider of BRP data, instead of implementation at many users;Faster and cheaper implementation of changes to the BRP due to social developments. Organisations now use rules themselves -each on their own- to derive information from BRP data. With the BRP APIs, deriving information from BRP data is done centrally. By centralising these rules, the impact of a change on connected government systems is much smaller than now.","The deployment of the algorithm provides benefits because the central processing ensures that less (sensitive) data is provided to users. These are government organisations, municipalities and other organisations performing a statutory task. By deploying the algorithm, there is less risk of unlawful processing of personal data. And the negative consequences that may arise from data breaches are reduced. The information query Age is used by organisations that need only the person's age, and not the date of birth, to carry out their processes. The only alternative to RvIG centrally processing the personal data is for users to process the data into information themselves - if required. This is the current practice. This means that the data from the BRP must first be provided to the user, after which the user himself edits the data into information. This represents a major invasion of the citizen's privacy compared to the use of the algorithm, as more personal data is provided than would happen with the algorithm. It also entails each user having to develop their own 'computational rules' to convert the data - if desired - into information. As a result, the same data may yield different information at different organisations. For example, mistakenly counting people with a letter address or deceased people as residents.","The Key Register of Persons Act (BRP) provides the basis/frameworks for recording (and updating) and providing personal data (Chapters 2 and 3 of the BRP Act). The BRP Act itself provides no basis for processing data into information that can be traced back to a person. However, Article 4.16a of the BRP Act does offer the possibility to temporarily deviate from provisions in the BRP Act by order in council (AMvB) for the purpose of data minimisation. This possibility is taken advantage of with the Experiment Data Minimisation BRP Decree: this AMvB, in conjunction with the BRP Act, provides the basis for processing and providing information.

Octobox Anonymisation,Municipality of Ede,"The algorithm in the software is mainly set to recognise and anonymise privacy-sensitive information in documents. Basis for this is the AVG. The tool is also used to highlight and mask information that cannot be shared for other reasons (based on another basis, e.g. the Woo) in a document. ",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation tool is used to give substance to transparency on the one hand and the necessary protection of individuals, companies and institutions to whom documents relate on the other.Transparency because it enables the municipality of Ede to share information according to regulations such as the Woo, either actively or passively. For citizens about whom data are included in documents to be published, the use means that there is no privacy violation thereby complying with the AVG. This also applies to the protection of privacy data of Ede municipality employees.The applicant of a Woo request receives the information she requested, either in an anonymised version or partially masked on a different basis. For the departments within the organisation responsible for handling a Woo request and/or publishing information, it means complying with laws and regulations. Use of the software reduces turnaround time and therefore contributes to being able to provide requested information within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low. This applies to individuals (citizens, employees of buying organisations) and companies and institutions. The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and masks or indicates them regardless of the further content of documents. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to a subject person, there are no automatic decisions. In addition, the tool has the option of manually masking information that cannot be made public for other reasons. With this, for example, a text fragment containing strategic information can be marked to protect one's own organisation or a partner organisation (government, company or institution). The basis for anonymising or masking is indicated in the box.","It happens that text excerpts in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo has provided Foundations on the basis of which that is possible. And the AVG is also such a basis for non-Woo publications. Without the use of the software, anonymising text fragments in documents would take significantly more time. Using the anonymisation tool speeds up and simplifies the process for active and passive disclosure. Automated anonymisation is also less error-prone than human intervention.

This model forms the basis of the analysis. The premise is that the value of a property is determined by the sum of the individual contributions of characteristics such as:Dwelling characteristics (e.g. use area, land area, year of construction)Location characteristics (e.g. proximity to amenities, neighbourhood demographics).Market condition (e.g. trends in supply and demand).Sales conditionsWhen valuing homes, the AI model uses LightGBM (decision trees). The algorithm analyses millions of combinations of characteristics (e.g. year of construction, type, usable area) and their influence on price. In doing so, it learns which combinations and patterns are statistically relevant. A decision tree divides the data into segments (e.g. homes of the same type or similar location) and determines which features have the most weight in predicting value. Visualisation is then made of which features contribute most to the final valuation.The model is trained and validated in two steps:Training set (80% of the data): here, the model learns relationships between characteristics and transaction prices.Test set (20% of the data): the model is validated here to check whether it can also correctly value new, unknown data.If the model performs well, it is applied to all properties.

Telephone Collection (Wahv),Central Judicial Collection Agency,"If a person receives a second reminder for a traffic fine and does not pay it (in full), he or she can be called by the CJIB. The algorithm predicts for which person it is more likely that a personal conversation over the phone is the appropriate means of making a payment or reaching a payment appointment.","Law, Traffic",,In use,"One of the most important social tasks CJIB faces is socially responsible debt collection. CJIB wants to support people as much as possible in meeting their payment obligations and prevent an unnecessary increase in debt among citizens. CJIB has therefore invested in recent years in a personalised approach to debtors and making it possible to make payment arrangements for people who cannot pay (immediately). To this end, CJIB has developed additional services and possibilities.The 'Telephone collection (Wahv)' algorithm supports one of these developed services. By proactively contacting people by phone who have outstanding claims (traffic offenders), CJIB can find out why they have not paid (in full). In this conversation, the CJIB employee can address any concerns about extra costs and tensions caused by the use of a bailiff by making an immediate payment, making a payment appointment or putting the person in contact with debt assistance. ","If a person receives a second reminder for a traffic fine and does not pay it (in full), the bailiff is then used. This step also follows from the law. The use of the bailiff involves, among other things, additional costs for the person. As stated, the goal of telephone debt collection is that the CJIB proactively calls those who do not (fully) pay the second demand for payment, in order to come to appropriate payment arrangements in a personal conversation and to prevent extra costs for citizens due to the use of the bailiff. CJIB cannot call everyone for this additional service. That is why an algorithm is deployed that predicts for which person a personal conversation over the phone is more likely to be the appropriate means for making a payment or arriving at a payment arrangement. By proactively contacting people by phone who have outstanding claims (traffic offenders), CJIB can find out why they have not paid (in full). In this conversation, the CJIB employee can take away any concerns about extra costs and tensions caused by deploying a bailiff by making an immediate payment, making a payment appointment or putting the person in contact with debt assistance.It also avoids additional social costs by deploying costly means of collection such as a bailiff.","The Administrative Enforcement of Traffic Regulations Act (also known as the Mulder Act or Wahv) regulates the administrative handling of common traffic offences in the Netherlands.

These datasets consist only of CJIB data on a person's traffic fines. They include the following data: the outstanding amount;the offence group to which the offence belongs;the Wahv payment history.",The algorithm predicts for which person it is more likely that a face-to-face conversation over the phone is the appropriate means of making a payment or arriving at a payment appointment. This is done with the help of a so-called decision tree. A decision tree works by asking questions that are answered with 'yes' or 'no'. This makes the algorithm easily explainable and transparent.,"The algorithm indicates which people with an outstanding traffic fine, CJIB should best call so that the use of the bailiff can be avoided. It is then up to the CJIB employee to decide who to call. For this, a person-oriented assessment takes place. This means, for example, that they look at whether there has been recent contact or whether an application for a payment arrangement has just been received.So whether a citizen is called is ultimately up to the CJIB employee himself. In this way, CJIB ensures meaningful human intervention.","CJIB is taking several measures to control and minimise the risks of the 'Telephone Collection (Wahv)' algorithm:1. Transparency: CJIB publishes information about the algorithm in the algorithm register, so that citizens have insight into how the algorithm works and which decisions it supports. By using a decision tree, the algorithm is clear and transparent. 2. Human intervention: Although the algorithm predicts which individuals would benefit most from a telephone contact, the final decision and conversation remains in the hands of an employee. This ensures that there is always a human assessment.3. Privacy protection: CJIB ensures that the data used by the algorithm is carefully managed and protected in accordance with applicable privacy laws.4. Responsibility: The quality, fairness and security of the data and the algorithm are considered when collecting the data and creating the algorithm.5. Monitoring and evaluation: CJIB continuously monitors the performance of the algorithm and regularly evaluates whether the algorithm produces the desired results without unintended negative effects.6.

Image recognition advertising tax,Municipality of Amsterdam,"Amsterdam wants a quieter streetscape and therefore wants to levy an advertising tax. Advertising tax must be paid for displays visible from the public road (such as façade advertisements, signs and window advertisements).",Work,,In use,"Amsterdam wants a quieter streetscape and therefore wants to levy an advertising tax. Advertising tax must be paid for expressions visible from the public highway (such as façade advertising, signs and window advertising). The size of the advertisement, in addition to the tariff (area) and the type of display, among other things, determines the amount to be paid. To collect the taxes, scan cars drive on the streets several times a year. The cameras in the scan cars recognise: advertisements; provide them with coordinates; with a date; measure the surface area; personal data such as faces and license plates are blurred and not stored. The system then makes a proposal to the employee for the advertisement. The clerk can see the image (photo) taken and the data captured. The clerk assesses this and determines the taxpayer and tax liability (type of advertisement and area). The system learns from this so that the cameras better recognise and measure the advertisement next time on the street. Before the assessment is made, the taxpayer can check in the digital counter of Taxes whether everything is correct and pass on changes. Then the tax assessment is sent and the Advertising Tax can be paid.Link to service described:https://www.amsterdam.nl/belastingen-heffingen/",,,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Advertisement For each recognised advertisement in the public space, an image of the public space showing that advertisement is used (via the coordinates). Personal data are blurred and not recorded. Location data The camera and associated software record the location of the recognised advertisement. To this end, geographical coordinates are recorded for the advertisement using the basic topographical map of the Netherlands. Date The date of detection is recorded. Type The type of advertisement is automatically recognised and recorded. Measurement The camera and associated software record the dimensions of the advertisement. The image, date, location and measurement are sent to the tax application. In doing so, the system creates a new tax object or links this data to an existing advertising object. Tax confidentiality applies to this data. Feedback The results of the employee's assessment such as type of advertising object, location and measurements are automatically fed back to the system. The system learns from this. Tax data The location data is used to link the advertising object to the WOZ object (e.g. shop). The tax data of that WOZ object is used to determine the taxpayer and compile the tax liability. Through a regular process, tax assessments are made. Tax secrecy applies to this data.","Architecture of the model: The algorithms are used to: Recognise a possible advertisement and capture it as an image. We adopt Cyclomedia's service which is widely used to capture public space. Patented positioning technology is used. This technology is not made public because it is company information. In the imagery, the system looks for the advertisements and records them in coordinates. This data is used to determine the tax object. The accuracy in the recognised objects is at least 95%. Through the learning effect, this percentage is being increased. In addition, there is a control process that uses file analysis to check whether there are tax objects (e.g. restaurant) where advertising is expected but for which no tax liability has been created. The location data of the advertising is recorded. This data is used to determine the taxpayer. To determine and record the type and dimensions of the advertisement. These data are used to determine the basis of taxation. Record the date of the observation. This data is used to determine the levy period. To learn from the data confirmed by the clerk. This data is used to further optimise image recognition. Performance Photogrammetry is involved. Photogrammetry deals with the interpretation and measurement of imagery in determining and describing the shape and size and location of objects. Here, the shape, location and dimensions are determined using mathematical models within an automated algorithm. The mathematical models used are not publicly available. This is confidential business information. No (inter)national standards for terrestrial positioning, photogrammetric and point cloud measurements are available. It is the employee who confirms the location and calculates the area of the advertisement. The rules governing this are set out in the tax ordinance. The employee's application of these rules thus determines the accuracy and precision of the measurement. The algorithm is self-learning. It uses the results of the employee's inspection to learn so that the image recognition becomes more accurate.",The system only makes a proposal for the advertisement to the clerk. The clerk always decides. The taxpayer has the opportunity to check the advertisements placed on assessment and submit amendments to them. The possibility of objecting and appealing against the assessment exists. This can be done at the digital desk of Taxes.,"The system is not risky in terms of privacy. It does not record personal data and only takes pictures of displays in public spaces. The biggest risk here is that the location of the advertisement becomes known, which could possibly make it possible to trace the address of a person or company. This is also possible on the street. Unauthorised persons cannot access the stored images due to the realised information security. Security risks are controlled by the overall security set-up on systems and connections. These meet the requirements. In execution, the biggest risk is that an advertisement is not scanned or measured correctly, resulting in someone getting the wrong assessment. However, the clerk always checks and determines the tax liability. The taxpayer can respond to the recorded advertisement and can object and appeal the tax assessment. 



In implementation, the biggest risk is that an advertisement is not scanned or measured correctly, resulting in a person receiving the wrong assessment. However, the clerk always checks and determines the tax liability. The taxpayer can respond to the recorded advertisement and can object and appeal the tax assessment.

The clerk determines whether the document is correctly anonymised.,"There is no risk of automated decision-making and the algorithm has no impact on fundamental rights because the algorithm does not make decisions with legal consequences. It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists. The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified. The risks do not outweigh the privacy benefits and the risk of poor anonymisation by not using this software.",Xxllnc,,,,,,,Other algorithms,"1: Woo, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754/. 2: WDO, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/NL/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046. 3: UAVG, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 4: Wep, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961. 5: Wdo, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0048156",1: DEDA anonimiseringssoftware. 2: DPIA anonimiseringssoftware,,78353493

Residents and visitors to Amsterdam are entitled to clean air and a liveable climate. The air that visitors and residents currently breathe is not clean enough and this is largely due to city traffic. The environmental zones for cars, trucks, vans, taxis, buses and mopeds and motorcycles in the municipality of Amsterdam have been set up to keep out the most polluting vehicles. By doing so, the municipality of Amsterdam aims to improve air quality in the city.Other entry or transit bans have been introduced by the municipality to improve road safety and quality of life, for example by preventing cut-through traffic or congestion.There is also automated enforcement of the 7.5-tonne zone to protect bridges and quay walls in the historic centre.The aim is to enforce environmental zones for passenger cars, trucks, vans, taxis, buses and mopeds and motorcycles in the municipality of Amsterdam established by traffic orders, so that the most polluting vehicles are kept out.The purpose enforcing the heavy traffic zone is to protect bridges and quay walls in the old centre.For the other zones, the aim is to enforce the underlying traffic orders of the municipality of Amsterdam.Within Amsterdam municipality's environmental zones, ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) cameras with algorithms are used to read license plates of passing vehicles. The license plate is then linked to information, such as vehicle information from the RDW (Dutch Road Transport Authority), to a date, time and location. Environmental zone enforcement is supported by several other rule-based algorithms. All these algorithms contribute to a decision with legal effect in case of violation of the environmental and other zones (penalty decision).","The impact for the use of the algorithm is proportionate to the goal, which is the right of Amsterdam residents to clean air, a liveable climate, traffic safety, an accessible city and a pleasant living environment. Environmental zones keep the most polluting vehicles out of the city, thereby improving the city's air quality. In the other zones, in particular, vehicles are barred that cause relatively high nuisance, affect road safety, reduce accessibility, e.g. due to their weight damaging bridges and quay walls that have to be closed off as a result, etc., thus contributing to reduced liveability.","- Preventing or limiting nuisance, annoyance or damage caused by traffic as well as the consequences for the environment referred to in the Environmental Management Act (art. 2 subsection 2 sub a WvW); - Promoting efficient or economical use of energy (art. 2 subsection 3 under a of the Act); - Traffic orders issued by the municipality of Amsterdam to promote road safety and quality of life based on the Wegenverkeerswet 1994 (Road Traffic Act 1994) and in the further regulations based on that Act, such as the Reglement verkeersregels en verkeerstekens 1990 (RVV 1990) and the Besluit administratieve bepalingen inzake het wegverkeer (BABW) (Road Traffic Administrative Provisions Decree). - An offence can be established ""in an automated manner"" on the basis of Article 3(2) of the Administrative Enforcement of Traffic Regulations Act (""Mulder Act"").",1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"1. licence plate recognition algorithm.When a vehicle passes by, an ANPR camera takes a picture and in that picture a registration number is searched based on shape (plate finder). Image recognition techniques are then used to search for characters. For this, the algorithm uses dots and lines. In this way, an image of numbers and letters is created. This algorithm uses a reference database filled mainly with Dutch license plates, which is the best way to recognise them. The majority of vehicles (around 97%) are vehicles with Dutch license plates.2. An algorithm that assesses the reliability of license plate recognition.The system assesses the probability of the license plate being read correctly. The result of recognising up to 5% of the license plates of a vehicle with a Dutch license plate may be categorised as unreliable. This data is then not processed.3. Vehicle recognition algorithmThis is an algorithm that is only used if it has been established by Algorithm 1 that a non-Dutch license plate exists. Algorithm 3 uses image analysis to determine whether the passing vehicle is a passenger vehicle, van, truck or bus. The numbers of vehicles by category, location and time of passing, without registration number, are used for policy purposes, such as analyses for traffic research.4. Decision algorithm access to a zoneTo determine whether a passing vehicle has access to the zone as defined in the traffic decision, the relevant vehicle data belonging to the detected license plate are automatically requested from the RDW. If, based on this, it is found that the right of access is present, the registration number is irrevocably removed from the passage control system. If the right is not present, the system automatically checks whether an exemption is known to be linked to the licence plate. If so, the badge is irrevocably removed from the passage control system. All these steps follow the traffic decision one-to-one. If no right and no exemption are found, a fine file is compiled automatically and forwarded to the CJIB, which sends the decision. A BOA randomly checks whether the detected registration number matches the one in the photo and whether there are reasons to dismiss a fine.","There are links with- RDW for retrieving vehicle data, exemptions issued by RDW and for owner data in the event of an offence- the BRP (Basic Registration of Personal Data) for private vehicles and with the Trade Register (Chamber of Commerce for commercial vehicles) to check whether the address details of the owner of a vehicle in violation are correct.- NPR (National Parking Register) for exemptions in car-free areas.- DigiD for applying for an exemption for environmental zones and viewing photos of a violation,- E-recognition, idem- TNO for linking the emission factor to passed vehicles for the environmental zones.","Sampling by special investigating officers (boas) is an integral part of this automated decision-making process. A spot check is the manual assessment of whether the registration number of the vehicle in the violation photo matches the registration number as identified by the recognition software. This is done by a BOA. 
If an objection has been lodged, a violation photo is always assessed again (manually) by a BOA. In addition, those involved can view the violation photo themselves via https//Mijn.Amsterdam.nl and DigiD.","There are two types of risk namely:1. The risk is that breaches are wrongly identified.2. Another risk is that violations are missed.These risks are further mitigated as follows: License plate recognition algorithm: minimal risk. If a registration number is misread and the misread registration number turns out to exist and belongs to a vehicle that does not have access to the environmental zone, the wrong person will be fined. This happens very rarely because the recognition software meets the tough requirements mentioned above and a check is made (randomly) by a BOA, and the chances of the incorrectly identified vehicle not having access to the environmental zone are small. In the single case that this does happen, an objection by the owner of the wrongly fined vehicle against the fine will of course be upheld. If the registration number of a vehicle that does not have access to the environmental zone is misread by the camera, the owner is wrongly not fined. This rarely happens. Other than by measures related to the reliability requirements for the recognition software in the cameras, this risk cannot be mitigated. Reliability estimation: this algorithm mitigates the above risks. Vehicle recognition algorithm: no risks because this algorithm does not lead to a fine. Decision access to a zone: no risk subject to a correctly read license plate (see algorithms 1 and 2).",Connection Systems,,"Environmental zone, camera, entry ban, car, roads",,,,,Impactful algorithms,,,,41958113
Risk control SDE++ subsidy applications,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,The algorithm is used to provide an SDE++ grant application with a risk indication. This is done before the application is assessed by an adviser and before a decision on an application is sent.,Economy,Algemene website SDE++:  https://www.rvo.nl/subsidies-financiering/sde   Pagina SDE++ Aanvraagronde:  https://www.rvo.nl/subsidies-financiering/sde/aanvragen  ,In use,"This algorithm helps to speed up the assessment process. As a result, the applicant hears faster whether the grant is awarded or rejected. In case of a positive decision, the applicant can immediately start implementing the project.","Thousands of applications are received per round. The algorithm gives each application a risk rating. An adviser then looks at the risks associated with the application. This risk indication speeds up the assessment because it immediately shows where the application is incomplete or incorrect in terms of content. If an application has no risks, a positive decision on the application is automatically created. This is based on the data entered by the applicant.  The alternative is that all applications are reviewed manually by an adviser for completeness and content. That process takes longer, which means applicants also have to wait longer for a decision. With many applications, it then becomes more difficult to assess all applications within the legal deadlines.  Decisions on whether or not to use the algorithm are made per application round. This depends on the number of applications received.   In this working method, we focus on applications up to a certain application amount, within a certain category. Applications for complicated techniques or for higher amounts are always fully assessed.   In addition to the algorithm, a sampling is done. Applications that fall into this sample are fully checked to see if the algorithm works properly.",Handling process assessment of SDE++ application round,1.0,,Via contactformulier:  https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/contact/formulier,nld,,"- Data from the application forms with accompanying annexes. On the application form, data on the applicant (name, Chamber of Commerce number, legal form and address details) and (technical and financial) data on the intended installation are entered. - Details of other applications from previous or the same application round. ","Risk analysis is a rule-based algorithm that is not self-learning. The algorithm has the following rules:Rules that determine, based on claim and category of the application, whether the application will be tested fully or through risk analysis.  Rules that check whether the application meets the specific conditions for the relevant category.   Rules that check an application for completeness. An application is given a risk rating in the absence of a mandatory annex.  Rules that check an application for substantive points and give it a risk indication if the application needs further substantive assessment.  First, the rules of the algorithm are created. Then the sample is run to check the rules and the rules are tightened based on results from the sample. Then, data analysis is performed based on the rules.  Applications are given a risk rating based on this analysis.  An assessment document is created in the file of all applications in which an application is assessed. The type of assessment document created for a file depends on whether an application is fully assessed or risk-based. For applications that are not given a risk indication after the risk analysis, a document is created with the outcome of the risk analysis. These applications are not further assessed and automatically receive a positive decision on their application. After an application has been assessed in the assessment document, a decision on the application follows.","Each application with a risk rating is reviewed by an adviser. The adviser reviews the item with a risk rating. If the application is not complete or the information is not sufficient, the applicant may be given a chance to provide additional information or explain something. The algorithm never provides an immediate rejection.  Applications for complicated techniques or applications above a certain amount are always assessed entirely by an adviser and not just on the at-risk part. From which application amount this applies is determined per round. The algorithm is checked with a sample. This checks whether the algorithm gives the right risk indications or whether it needs to be adjusted. It may also be decided not to use the algorithm and to assess all applications manually. This depends on the number of applications received and the results of the sample.","Risk: Applications do not receive the correct risk indication  Because applications without a risk indication are not assessed by a consultant, there is a risk that an application will wrongly receive a positive decision. The consequence of a wrongly granted decision is that another project will not receive a decision if there is a budget depletion. An unduly granted decision does not mean that the grant will actually be paid out. Only when all conditions of the realisation phase (phase from receipt of the positive grant decision to operation of production facility) are met, advances are paid. Under this method, we focus on applications up to a certain application amount and applied for in a certain category. Applications for complex techniques and for a high subsidy amount will always be fully assessed.    The algorithm can wrongly give applications a risk indication, resulting in the assessment process taking longer.  To avoid the above risks, the algorithm is checked with a sample. Applications that fall into the sample are assessed integrally by an adviser. The sample is used to test whether the algorithm's rules are chosen correctly and the rules can be tightened.

",,,1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Name: 3D point cloudsDataset descriptionThe input data are the 3D point clouds made with a LiDAR scanner in 2020. The points have x, y, z coordinates, a colour and intensity.The points are first semantically segmented and then clustered into individual lamp posts. To train the model, a subset of the data was used, from 50 pieces in Amsterdam East. This subset was annotated. This was partly done automatically and then corrected by a human. Initial tests were carried out in Weesp and the Oosterpark neighbourhood in Amsterdam Oost. The final operational model uses the dataset of all of Amsterdam. For the automatic annotation, we also use AHN4 and BGT data to determine, for example, the land and location of buildings.Licence: right of use within the municipalityOperatingPersonal data:No personal dataSource:Street LiDAR | Cyclomedia","Description of the system architecture:The first step is the semantic segmentation of point clouds. Here, we classify points into regions based on their meaning. We determine whether something is part of a lamppost or not. For this, we use RandLA-Net (QingyongHu/RandLA-Net (github.com)). The next step is to cluster all points that belong to lampposts. We use connected-component labelling for this purpose. We remove noise and eventually arrive at pieces of point clouds that belong to an individual lamppost. For each cluster found, we use prinicipal component analysis to create a fit for each lamp post. From this fit, we can easily derive the properties of the pole. The code for these last two steps can be found on our github: Amsterdam-AI-Team/Urban_PointCloud_Analysis PerformancePerformance first step in data processing (semantic segmentation with RandLA-Net): the intersection-over-union for the lamppost class is 82. Performance second step (identifying individual lampposts): a significant proportion (about a third) of the lampposts found are in reality not lampposts (false positives). These are picked out by humans (see heading 'human monitoring').Performance third step (fit per lamp post): in 91 per cent of cases the fit was correct and in the remaining 9 per cent was corrected by a human.","Each found lamp post (and its associated fit) is checked by a human.

Support Income Settlement Assistance (OIB),Municipality of Amsterdam,"If someone receives social assistance benefits, other income must be offset against the benefits. This is because the assistance supplements income up to the assistance standard.",Social Security,,In development,"If someone receives social assistance benefits, other income must be offset against the benefits. This is because the assistance supplements income up to the assistance standard. The Income Offset Assistance (OIB) support helps create a complete picture of this income. With information from the Inlichtingenbureau, this functionality allows us to set off the net income against the benefit.The municipality of Amsterdam has a statutory duty to pay the benefit correctly. Anyone who receives or applies for social assistance benefits has a duty to provide information. The Participation Act obliges the benefit recipient to provide all the information the municipality needs to determine the right to assistance. A change in income must therefore be reported to the municipality of Amsterdam. The municipality of Amsterdam sends a monthly paper income declaration to a benefit recipient who receives income from work. The benefit recipient must return the completed income declaration and indicate whether the income differs from the income data known to the municipality. The benefit recipient must also provide a payslip so that the income consultant can set off the correct amounts. This is error-prone and often causes a lot of stress for the benefit recipient.Settling income quickly and correctly is in the interest of both the welfare recipient and the municipality. Settlement of income should not create a barrier for a benefit recipient to start working. This is why the municipality has designed the Income Settlement Assistance Support (OIB).The main purpose of the OIB is to simplify services for the benefit recipient. The functionality retrieves the income data of Amsterdam benefit recipients from the Inlichtingenbureau. A paper income declaration is then no longer needed. Tests and a pilot in 2021, showed that the data from the Inlichtingenbureau are reliable and can be used for this application. The municipality of Amsterdam is allowed to use this data as it concerns residents on welfare benefits. With this data, the process is more efficient and less error-prone. It reduces the risk of incorrect settlement or late reporting of income. ",,,1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"The dataset only includes people who receive subsistence benefits from the municipality of Amsterdam and receive income from employment, and/or benefits and pensions. The Inlichtingenbureau dataset uses a component code that allows us to identify the type of income involved.Furthermore, the dataset describes the following data: Component codeName of employer; Taxable wage; Net wage; Use of wage tax credit;  Holiday pay reservation;BSNA (processor) agreement has been concluded with the supplier Wigo4it. Wigo4it was founded in 2007 by the four largest cities in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht) and together they have developed a functionality to offset income data against benefits in the income system Socrates. This application is used to apply for and provide welfare and income benefits, among other things.Data collected by: Municipality of AmsterdamEmployee Insurance Agency (UWV)Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB)BelastingdienstIntelligence Bureau (IB) (no source holder, but responsible for technical infrastructure provided by the Bureau Keteninformatisering Werk en Inkomen (BKWI))Type of data:Financial information, income from employment or pension, of Amsterdam residents on welfare benefits. Information that an income counsellor needs to be able to offset the income of benefit recipients against the (welfare) benefit.","Description of the system architectureThe Amsterdam municipality retrieves a file from the Inlichtingenbureau via a secure portal on a monthly basis. With this, we determine whether people with too low income or assets qualify for benefits or additional provisions, such as special assistance. The Inlichtingenbureau receives the data from the Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen (UWV), the Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB) and the Belastingdienst.After this, the municipality of Amsterdam delivers the file to the supplier of the income system. They load the following data into the income system:Income category (component code)Type of incomePeriodicityEmployer/institution/personPayroll tax numberReservation VTWage tax credit appliedAfter this, the income system adds the data from the file to the customer's file. Then the income offset calculation can be made to determine what portion of the benefit should be paid. Earlier, we did this based on the income statement of the benefit recipient.The income offset is performed only if the above fields are filled correctly. The income statement differs from one employer to another, making it specialist work to properly read the information provided.If the data is entered correctly, the income system makes a proposal for the income to be offset. An income consultant from the Amsterdam municipality assesses the proposal. In case of (large) deviations compared to the previous month, the municipality contacts the welfare recipient to discuss the difference. If necessary, the income consultant will adjust the data before the settlement is carried out.If the data are not entered correctly, an income consultant from the Amsterdam municipality will manually enter or complete them. For this, the income consultant will receive a work order in the benefit system. After the income consultant fills in or completes the data, the income system still calculates which part of the benefit should be paid to the citizen so that the citizen's income is supplemented to the benefit level.The result of the settled income is reflected in the benefit statement for the month in question. The benefit specification is a decision. About the specification, the benefit recipient can always ask for an explanation or clarification. If there is a mistake in the settlement, it can always be corrected by the income counsellor.Performance:Between February 2022 and February 2024 and additional research done. This showed that the data is reliable and up-to-date and can therefore be used for income settlement. For benefit recipients who receive income alongside their benefits, in the near future it will no longer be mandatory to submit income online or manually. This obligation often creates uncertainty and problems, as benefit recipients are unable to provide this information in time or the information provided by the benefit recipient is incomplete. Misfiling can also affect the family's total benefit. For example, in the case where part of the family is employed and part of the family is not.The data from the Intelligence Bureau and the offsetting of income by the income system makes the offsetting of income more reliable. The way this is calculated and the final end result remain the same.","Sometimes the Information Bureau data do not lead to a proposal for an amount to be offset in the income system. For example, when someone starts working for the first time or if someone receives more than EUR 150 than the previous month. In those cases, the benefit recipient is always contacted. As in the manual process, the income counsellor makes the final decision. As a result, the final outcome can be adjusted at any time and the impact for the benefit recipient is low. The income counsellors of the Amsterdam municipality use the income system, which processes the data from the Inlichtingenbureau. They can adjust the data in the income system at the request of the benefit recipient. The income consultant makes the final judgement on the data provided by the Inlichtingenbureau. The data from the Intelligence Bureau serves as support and to improve the reliability of the data.Level of human control:human-in-the-loop","The process has a low risk of errors that may affect a benefit recipient's ongoing entitlement. As soon as a difference in income is detected, the income consultant discusses it with the benefit recipient. Currently, this is the case in about 30 per cent of cases. Based on the discussion, and any additional information, the actual income is recorded in the file used for the income calculation. The development of this functionality involves personal data, combined datasets, and data processed on a large scale. Given these risk factors, the data is handled very carefully and there are secure connections between the Inlichtingenbureau, the Amsterdam municipality and Wigo4it. The number of employees accessing the functionality is as limited as possible.Mitigation:If the data from the Intelligence Bureau do not match or contain ambiguities, an income consultant discusses this with the benefit recipient. The functionality is still under development and the income system cannot currently produce a proposal for settlement for every benefit recipient. Currently, about 75 per cent of incomes are processed through OIB. If necessary, the data is further examined and the actual income is manually recorded in the file used for income calculation.The Intelligence Bureau is involved in data processing. This data delivery is regulated in article 64 paragraph 4 of the Participation Act. The Suwi Decree in article 5.24 paragraph 3 states that the Intelligence Agency and the college are jointly responsible for the processing.Wigo4it is also involved in implementing the process. Wigo4it regularly conducts 'pen and hack tests' to check that the Socrates income system cannot be hacked by third parties. Socrates is the IT system that ensures welfare recipients receive the correct benefit. Wigo4it is ISO certified, which means that the risk of a data leak is low.

Performing Wage Value Measurement,Municipality of Amsterdam,Application supports the process of determining wage value. The aim of the application is to determine wage value in a uniform manner; a national methodology for this has been available since 2021. ,Social Security,,In development,"Application supports the process of determining wage value. The aim of the application is to determine the wage value in a uniform manner; a national methodology for this has been available since 2021. Under the Participation Act, those entitled to benefits can apply for guidance and the instruments of the Directorate for Work and Participation. If a person has a suspected work limitation, a wage-value determination can be used to measure reduced labour productivity. The moment an employee's productivity is lower than an average employee, you as an employer can receive compensation for this in the form of a labour cost subsidy. The amount of the wage subsidy is determined by a wage-value expert in the form of a wage-value measurement.Due to a work limitation, the employee is unable to offer full productivity. At that point, the municipality subsidises part of the wage and guidance costs. The productivity not provided is measured and compensated with a wage subsidy to the employer that supplements the established wage value to the level of the legal minimum wage. The uniform wage value methodology calculates the (reduced) labour productivity of an employee on of the three variables: pace, quality and net working time.","The percentage of reduced wage value is calculated with the algorithm entirely according to the legal rules. A manual calculation will give the same outcome. The mere fact that this is now automated does not in itself have any consequences for the employee's employment contract and income.The wage value percentage can be seen as special personal data, because it says something about the employability of the person in question. When determining the wage value, it concerns only the degree of limitation, not the nature of the limitation.",,1.0,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"The wage-value measurement consists of an observation of the workplace and a conversation between the wage-value expert, the employee and the employer. Prior to the workplace visit, input is requested from the employer and the employee through two questionnaires (see appendix A Employer Questionnaire and B Employee Questionnaire). The questions and data relate to the employee's range of tasks and make a comparison with the norm function of regular employees. The norm function is a comparable function performed by a person without a work limitation. The norm function and/or the main tasks are always grafted onto a regular function 'common' within the industry or sector. The data used in the report is structured according to the steps of the uniform wage-value determination:purpose of the wage-value measurement;employee and employer data, such as name, address, place of residence/location, employer contact name;task and hour analysis: an analysis of the tasks the employee has and the number of hours he can work in the job concerned;norm function;determination of work performance and wage value;advice on reassessment of wage value.","Data processing begins the moment a professional from the Amsterdam municipality places an application to perform a wage-value measurement. The application starts the process of conducting the wage-value measurement and a wage-value expert is linked to it. The wage value expert makes an appointment with the employer for the wage value measurement. After confirming the appointment, both the employee and the employer receive information about the wage-value measurement and a questionnaire. The wage value measurement is carried out in accordance with the uniform wage value methodology based on an interview with the employee and the employer and an observation in practice. The wage value expert explicitly states during the introduction that the wage value measurement is carried out objectively based on actual observations and sources. The wage value expert tests the statements and assumptions of employee and employer by actual observations during the performance of work and by consulting sources. This prevents the process or advice from being influenced by the employee, employer or personal insights. After performing the wage-value measurement, the data are entered into the application by the wage-value expert. A wage value expert enters data on the three variables pace, quality and net working time of the employee into the application (substantiation and calculation of variables compared to a regular employee) to calculate the percentage (reduced) wage value.Calculating the percentage (reduced) wage value is seen as an algorithm. The algorithm uses the following formula (in accordance with national practice): % pace x % quality x % net working time = % labour productivity.The application assists in going through the steps of the uniform wage value determination, checks whether information has been entered and checks whether data have been entered correctly. The wage value expert will provide an explanation in the advice, which also describes the development perspective and any interventions. Both the employee and the employer are given access to the report. The views of the employee and the employer are stated separately in the report. Only after approval of the report by the employee and the employer is it given final status. After the wage-value measurement has been carried out, the client is informed. PerformanceThe application generates a percentage of reduced labour productivity compared to a regular employee in accordance with national practice. In addition, it is possible to determine the duration of the wage-value measurement and, if necessary, to give advice on support. To determine the wage values, an independent party, Blik op Werk, periodically checks whether the national method is being complied with. If in doubt about the measurement, independent advice can be requested from a client support organisation (in accordance with the national working method).","The percentage of wage-value reduction is calculated by the application, but is always checked by the wage-value expert. A change in the percentage is possible if it appears that there is new information regarding one of the three variables (pace, quality and net working time).If there are changes in the employee's circumstances that may affect the wage value, the employer is obliged to cooperate in a new wage value survey. The report and the result of the measurement are always discussed with the person in question. This person must always agree to further use of the wage-value measurement. There is also the possibility of objecting to the measurement.Level of human control:human-in-the-loop","The employees who perform the wage-value determination are certified specialists for this purpose. The register wage-value experts carry out uniform wage-value measurements for benefit recipients according to a national procedure. There is little or no impact on the individual, in this case the employee, when carrying out the wage-value measurement. The employee receives the same salary regardless of the outcome of the wage value measurement. A lower percentage of wage value means more wage subsidy for the employer, a higher percentage of wage value results in a lower wage subsidy. For this reason, the risk for the individual is low.Personal data and sensitive data play a role when performing the wage-value measurement. Given these risk factors, the data is handled very carefully and there are secure connections between the application for determining wage value and the municipality of Amsterdam. The number of employees with access to the application and the associated personal data of the employee is also limited as much as possible.

Object Recognition Public Space Containers,Municipality of Amsterdam,Directorate V&amp;OR commissioned the Computer Vision Team of the City of Amsterdam to explore how object recognition can help prevent vulnerable bridges and quay walls from collapsing as heavy objects are placed on them. ,"Economy, Space and Infrastructure",,In development,"Directorate V&amp;OR commissioned the Computer Vision Team of the City of Amsterdam (hereafter CVT) to explore how object recognition can help prevent vulnerable bridges and quay walls from collapsing due to heavy objects being placed on them. Containers are heavy objects that increase the risk of collapse. Currently, there is no clear view of where these containers are located in (vulnerable) parts of the city. During the Pilot, we will test whether containers can be successfully recognised in public spaces with a scanning vehicle equipped with a camera. After recognising containers in public spaces, a signal can be generated. By providing this signal with additional information from (municipal) sources, the work of supervisors can also be carried out better. This can be done, for example, by including in a report information on how urgent the signal is based on the vulnerability of the particular quay on which the container has been placed. As a result, urgent situations can be prioritised. In addition to generating a signal, employees can use a digital map showing the containers found. Update 2024:The pilot has now been successfully completed. It has been shown that containers can be successfully recognised and that the technology can be used to identify misplaced containers more effectively.","The bridges and quay walls in the city centre have been severely weakened by years of excessive loads. At the time these bridges and quays were built, there was no heavy traffic. We are strengthening or replacing the bridges and quay walls. Therefore, heavy traffic and heavy objects are now prohibited in several places.",,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Training dataset for algorithm development:The municipality used an already available dataset for the development of the image recognition and blur algorithm. Blur algorithmIt involved roughly 10,000 images of raw, i.e. not anonymised, data. These images were needed to teach the algorithm to manually recognise people and license plates so that they can be removed from images. These images are only accessible to a few developers who train the models. The images will be kept for as long as the algorithm may need further development.Image recognition algorithmTo teach this algorithm to recognise containers properly, roughly 1,500 partly anonymised and partly non-anonymised images were used to train the algorithm manually. Using non-anonymised images was necessary for this, so that the context (public space of the municipality of Amsterdam) is kept intact as much as possible. This ensures that the algorithm is better able to recognise the containers. Unlike e.g. Google Maps, the municipality also blurs the entire posture of people in public space.Production data:The Scan system captures images containing metadata such as date, time, location and heading.These images are then all anonymised using the blur algorithm developed by the municipality of Amsterdam. Immediately after this, the images are filtered for images with containers on them with the image recognition algorithm 'containers'. All images on which no containers are visible are immediately removed.After previous data is obtained, it is enriched with information from permits and information about vulnerable bridges and quay walls. It is then investigated whether the container is located on a vulnerable bridge or quay wall.Based on the above data, the following information can then be generated:Category Orange (or Red): potentially illegal object (on vulnerable quay)Distance to vulnerable quay: 25 metresDistance to object permit: 40 metresThe above data is sent to the Signals Information Agency Amsterdam. SIA processes this into a 'signal' provided with a map with location indication and forwards it to CityControl, so that a supervisor can work with it. Anonymised images showing containers are reused to re-train/improve the image recognition algorithm.","PerformanceThe algorithms perform well based on results with the training dataset. The intended Pilot is necessary to test the algorithms with production data. Performance is measured accurately during the Pilot. Nevertheless, each algorithm also has a so-called margin of error. The CFT has investigated this and these occur in the following situation:Image recognition algorithmThe container is too far away so the algorithm does not recognise the container. However, the risk of missing the container is small, now that it is likely that in the high-risk area, the scanning vehicle will eventually pass the container anyway, allowing it to be recognised.  Blural algorithmThe blur algorithm currently has an accuracy of roughly 95% for people standing close to the camera. For people standing further away from the camera, it is around 92%. Through visual inspection on a sample, it was found that the people who are not recognised are usually not recognisable because they are, for example, partially behind a tree. Ideally, of course, these persons would also be blurred. In the coming months, the blurring algorithm will be further developed. The performance is expected to improve further and approximate 99%. For the Pilot, and given all the measures taken to process the images safely, the 95% accuracy is considered sufficient for now. As additional measures, images based on which no signal is generated will be removed. This will be done within 24 hours.  Update 2024: Blurring as a Service (BaaS) has now been deployed, this will be used in a possible follow-up project to anonymise the images.","There is no automated decision-making by using the image recognition facility. The facility does generate a signal automatically. This signal is then assessed (manually) by a supervisor, after which an off-site investigation may take place. The supervisor makes an independent assessment of whether the situation is legal or illegal. If the latter, an enforcer will make an independent decision. With this, there is sufficiently meaningful human intervention. The 'output' of the algorithms does contribute to making the 'decision' whether or not to conduct further investigation (field investigation) into the observed container in the public space. Thus, the facility (with its associated algorithms) does have a substantial influence. ","Across the board, measures have been taken to process the data securely and to resolve incidents (for example: the blurring algorithm no longer works) quickly and effectively according to established procedures. In particular, there is attention within the project to carefully anonymise the ambient images created and remove redundant data. In addition, much attention is paid to the end users of the facility. They must be well informed about how the facility works (with its algorithms) and what the potential risks are. Supervisors should always be able to arrive at choices independently. As a result, it is important that the output can be interpreted properly and that they can also set aside a signal. ",,,Image recognitionContainers,,,,,Impactful algorithms,,,,59759977

Safe Alternative/Top 600,Municipality of Amsterdam,"To make the city safer, the municipality, together with its social partners, coordinates various approaches at the intersection of safety, care and the social domain from the Action Centre for Safety and Care (AcVZ). ",Public Order and Safety,,In use,"To make the city safer, the municipality, together with its social partners, coordinates various approaches at the intersection of safety, care and the social domain from the Action Centre for Safety and Care (AcVZ). The hallmarks of these approaches are customisation within a person-centred approach. Top 600 and Safe Alternative are two programmes aimed at reducing the number of high-impact crimes, also known as High Impact Crime or HIC (robberies, street robberies, burglaries, serious violence, murder/killing) and drug trafficking-related drug and violent crimes. This is done using an integrated person-centred approach (tailor-made approach) targeting people who are repeatedly suspected and convicted of such offences. The approach is aimed at stopping crime, improving the opportunities and quality of life of these persons, preventing the negative influence of these persons on their minor siblings, if any, and their minor children, and protecting the victims and the environment of these persons from anything that arises from criminal behaviour. The difference between the Top 600 and the Top 400 is that the Safe Alternative focuses on the group aged 12 to 23 years old, who are even less advanced criminally (e.g. fewer convictions) but with clear signs of concern(s). The Top 600 focuses on individuals with a solid criminal (HIC) background, and who are not (or no longer) on the Safe Alternative list. The Top 600 and Safe Alternative are two programmes of the Action Centre for Safety and Care (AcVZ), where a network of (government) parties jointly tackle social problems in the field of safety and care. Which problems these are is jointly determined by the organisations that make up the AcVZ, under the direction of the City of Amsterdam.",,,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Individuals can only enter the Top 600 and Safe Alternative if they meet the criteria of these approaches. Exactly what these criteria are are determined by the joint partners of the Action Centre for Safety and Care (AcVZ) and are described in the AcVZ covenant and the data processing arrangements under it that belong to these approaches. The criteria are available on the AcVZ website, as are the covenants, arrangements and who the partners are. Generally, there are 'intake moments' twice a year for both approaches. Persons who meet the criteria flow in, those who no longer meet them flow out. Data from: Police criteria: If suspects are arrested for a High Impact Crime (arrested at least once within five years) or if suspects are arrested for a misdemeanour (arrested at least twice within two years) Care criteria: Contains at least three of the following criteria:*has a judicial order on the reference date; *has a civil measure on the reference date; *compulsory school report or absentee or absolute absentee or early school leaver or more than 3x school changes in *basic school age or more than 2x school changes in secondary (special) education;*involved in domestic violence incident;*Apprehended as a suspect between the ages of 12 and 14;*Apprehended for APV (General Administrative Order) offence dealing in fake dope;*been part of a prioritised youth group on the reference date. The data lists are supplied by various parties and, based on the criteria, a list of persons eligible for the approach is produced. For the top 600 criteria, see ""Technical operation"" point 2.","1. Each incoming dataset has already been filtered by the supplying party for the relevant part of the criteria. For example, the police only supply the names of persons who currently meet the police part of the criteria (number of arrests, of a certain type, in the past 2 or 5 years). All incoming data is then checked by analysts for accuracy, to make sure that the persons in one dataset are the same as in the other dataset(s). The datasets are then juxtaposed to reveal which individuals meet each part of the criteria. Once this has been done with all relevant parts of the criteria, those persons who currently meet the criteria remain. The selection of persons in the Safe Alternative and Top600 therefore consists only of adding up a certain criterion (e.g. arrests, or compulsory education records) in a certain period (usually 2 or 5 years), and then juxtaposing those results to see which persons meet each component of the criteria.

Staff from Supervision &amp; Enforcement investigate them. The algorithm helps prioritise the reports so that limited enforcement capacity can be used efficiently and effectively. By analysing data, the algorithm estimates the risk that the property at the reported address is illegally let. To do so, the algorithm uses data from illegal holiday rentals from the past five years. This includes reports, data collected by the municipality during the work process, personal data (Basic Registration of Persons) and data on buildings (Basic Registration of Addresses and Buildings).",,,1.0,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Identity and housing data (BRP) A limited set of data from the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) on the identity and housing situation of the occupants, namely: name of registered occupants; date of birth; Amsterdam departure date; address departure date; address settlement date; date of death.

The algorithm calculates which information is more likely to be associated with illegal holiday rentals and which information is not. The algorithm does this by performing mathematical calculations according to the probability tree principle. That is, the algorithm takes an average based on a large number of probabilities. This average is used to generate the mathematical expectation of illegal holiday rentals at an address. The algorithm calculates this expectation only when we receive a new report (e.g. from a local resident or rental platform) of possible illegal holiday rentals. This algorithm is called a 'random forest regression algorithm'. To make the trade-offs made by the algorithm understandable to people, we apply the ""SHAP"" methodology (SHapley Additive exPlanations; https://github.com/slundberg/shap). For each individual case, SHAP calculates which indicators contributed to that prediction and whether this caused the prediction to be higher or lower. This way, an employee can always see what the algorithm based the risk estimate on and make a considered decision.        Performance The advantage of a 'random forest regression' is that it is a reasonably complex algorithm that can closely approximate reality. But there is a chance of overfitting. A 'tree' with many layers squeezes the data to deliver specific answers. It has been studied how many layers the model needs to remain generically deployable and thus not overfitting. In addition, data points are continuously categorised (grouped) so that the model has a manageable number of possibilities instead of an infinite number with continuous values. This improves the model's ability to reach a conclusion.","There is no automated decision-making. When we investigate an address for suspected illegal holiday rentals, it comes from a report from, for example, a local resident or a rental platform. The algorithm helps Supervision &amp; Enforcement staff determine which reports are most likely to be illegal rentals, so those reports can be investigated first. The employee is shown an overview, which shows based on which criteria the algorithm estimates the risk of illegal holiday rentals to be high or low. In this way, we provide insight into what the algorithm has based its risk assessment on. Whether illegal holiday lets are actually present is determined by the supervisor responsible and the project enforcer. A preliminary and field investigation is carried out for this purpose. Subsequently, the file is intensively discussed in a debriefing with the employees who can proceed to decision-making. The algorithm has a substantial influence on the order in which we deal with reports, but does not independently make decisions on whether or not illegal holiday rentals are involved. To prevent employees from putting too much faith in the algorithm, someone has been appointed to monitor the algorithm and its operation. In addition, work instructions have been drafted for the employees who will work with this tool. In doing so, employees attend workshop on the opportunities and risks of using algorithms.","The system obviously affects the potential offender. Indeed, a report may be given more or less priority than without the algorithm. We have taken several measures to ensure that all risk estimates of the algorithm are not based on chance. One important measure is that we extensively and continuously evaluate this algorithm in a pilot phase for e.g. reliability, before implementing it in operations.",,,NotificationMonitoring and enforcement,,,,,Impactful algorithms,,,,99175375

Payroll tax risk model - Supervision of foreign service providers for payroll taxes (TBD),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,"The 'Supervision of Foreign Service Providers (TBD)' algorithm is part of the Payroll Tax Risk Model, which helps Tax Administration staff supervise the correct and complete withholding and remittance of payroll taxes.",Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"The Tax Authority supervises the correct and complete withholding and remittance of payroll taxes. Payroll taxes consist of wage tax, national insurance contributions, employee insurance contributions and income-related healthcare insurance contributions, and must be remitted by employers via the payroll tax return. The payroll tax risk model helps Tax and Customs Administration staff monitor proper compliance with legislation relevant to payroll taxes. There are several laws and regulations that affect this supervision. One such law is the Law on Working Conditions for Posted Workers in the EU (WagwEU). This regulates the right to the main conditions of employment for workers who come to work temporarily in the Netherlands. There are a number of administrative obligations that are part of this law. One of these obligations concerns the reporting of workers posted in the Netherlands by the foreign service provider. This is done through a specific online reporting office. The Tax and Customs Administration receives these reports of employees posted in the Netherlands from the Social Insurance Bank to carry out supervision.The algorithm TBD is designed to detect foreign service providers who may have wrongly failed to pay payroll taxes for employees posted in the Netherlands. It can then investigate whether wage taxes are indeed wrongly not remitted. This is done by calling, sending a letter or via an inspection visit, among other things.","This algorithm allows the Tax and Customs Administration to use its limited supervisory capacity more efficiently. The use of the algorithm increases the chances of approaching the right foreign service provider for an interview or investigation.The use of algorithms makes supervision more efficient and effective than if detection and selection were done manually.

Directorate of Engineering, specifically Lead Buyer Physical, uses an external internet site for making a probabilistic run-through of an estimate, which performs a Monte Carlo simulation on the input of the estimate. The output consists of a value for the reliability of the estimate and a top 10 components that make the highest contribution to it. The Monte Carlo Methodology is based on an algorithm. The description of the methodology reads: 

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimisation, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.

The internet site used works with automated Monte Carlo algorithms and generates information that is used in credit decisions.

Signal Model Sales Tax Large Enterprises (SOB GO),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,"The algorithm 'Signal Model OB GO', hereafter abbreviated as SOB GO, helps Tax Administration staff to assess the risk of turnover tax returns that fall within the target group of Large Enterprises. About 7% of the returns involve returns by natural persons.",Public finance,https://over-ons.belastingdienst.nl/onderwerpen/omgaan-met-gegevens/algoritmeregister/,In use,"Almost every entrepreneur submits sales tax (OB) returns. Some of the entrepreneurs who are required to file OB returns in the Netherlands fall under the supervision of the Large Enterprises Directorate. Since 1 October 2024, the employees of the Large Companies Directorate have been supported by SOB GO in assessing these OB returns. The algorithm detects possible discrepancies in the returns based on relevant data available to the Tax Administration, and on business rules formulated by experienced staff.The purpose of the algorithm is to help the Tax Administration employee with advice on which returns are potentially risky and therefore may need to be handled manually.  In addition, the algorithm provides information for (in particular) client coordinators, who are the contact persons for large businesses at the Tax Administration. This information is important for the client picture that the Large Enterprises Directorate carefully builds up. The actual decision to assess a return, or to use information in client handling, lies with the specialised staff and client coordinators.","The algorithm supports Tax Administration staff with advice on which returns may require manual processing. This makes better use of employees' available capacity. Employees need to spend less time on declarations that are (probably) completely correct and do not need to be checked. To keep track of the returns that are (probably) fully correct as well as to check the business rules used, samples are also taken from the returns that are not selected for assessment.The sales tax return process has become more effective with the use of the algorithm.

Octobox Anonymisation,Province of Utrecht,"The algorithm in the software is mainly set to recognise and anonymise privacy-sensitive information in documents. Basis for this is the AVG. The tool is also used to highlight and mask information that cannot be shared for other reasons (based on another basis, e.g. the Woo) in a document. ",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation tool is used to give substance to transparency on the one hand and the necessary protection of the individuals, companies and institutions to whom documents relate on the other.Transparency because it enables the organisation to share information according to regulations such as the Woo, either actively or passively. For the citizen about whom there is data in documents to be published, use means that there is no privacy violation and the organisation thus complies with the AVG. The same applies to the protection of privacy data of the organisation's employees.The applicant of a Woo request receives the information she asked for, either in anonymised version or partially masked on a different basis. For the departments within the organisation responsible for handling a Woo request and/or publishing information, it means complying with laws and regulations. Use of the software reduces turnaround time and therefore contributes to being able to provide requested information within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low. This applies to individuals (citizens, employees of buying organisations) and companies and institutions. The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and masks or indicates them regardless of the further content of documents. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to a subject person, there are no automatic decisions. In addition, the tool has the option of manually masking information that cannot be made public for other reasons. With this, for example, a text fragment containing strategic information can be marked to protect one's own organisation or a partner organisation (government, company or institution). The basis for anonymising or masking is indicated in the box.","It happens that text excerpts in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo has provided Foundations on the basis of which that is possible. And the AVG is also such a basis for non-Woo publications. Without the use of the software, anonymising text fragments in documents would take significantly more time. Using the anonymisation tool speeds up and simplifies the process for active and passive disclosure. Automated anonymisation is also less error-prone than human intervention. This reduces the risk of a data breach and better protects individuals' data.",General data protection regulation (AVG)Environment ActGeneral Administrative Law Act (AWB)Disclosure ActOpen Government Act (WOO)Electronic Publications Act (WEP),1.0,,algoritmes@provincie-utrecht.nl,nld,,"At the beginning of use, a setup document was compiled by organisation and supplier.

Staff names may be missing from the Basic Model and added in advance. Another preference the organisation may indicate is, for example, the format in which an e-mail address is made unrecognisable.","Based on smart rules, the software searches through the texts of every document in the offered file. Certain texts, words or character combinations are recognised as traceable data, such as Citizen Service Numbers, Bank Account Numbers, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, dates, residential addresses and postal codes.The software can be set to the degree of certainty in which a condition is met. For the employee, the screen indicates which text fragments should be lacquered with certainty, and which meet the established smart rule to a lesser extent. Through the screen, the employee can approve or reject the proposals, and also amend for approval. The collaborator can also mark text itself and make it eligible for varnishing, including adding a basis. It is possible for a second collaborator to check the work of the first. Once all (pages of all) documents in the file have been reviewed, the final version is created, in a suitable format for publication.","Human intervention and control is always the norm in use. The software works on the basis of a setup document. Through this setup document and various mechanisms, the organisation can tailor/parameterise algorithm use to its own unique situation. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to a subject person. No automated decisions are involved. The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and marks or designates it regardless of further document content. The subject matter person handles the suggestions and indicates where they are correct, corrects where it should. If necessary, this work can also be reviewed within the software by a second person. For the citizen, this means that the organisation is working demonstrably and proportionately to eliminate (the risk of) privacy violations and thus comply with the AVG.","To mitigate the risk of documents being insufficiently anonymised, human verification always takes place. This involves full control where the software can be used intuitively to check or modify/enrich. If no human control were to take place when anonymising documents, various risks could arise, especially as a result of disclosing or publishing privacy-sensitive data. This tool in conjunction with humans, helps prevent this:Violation of privacy laws:The inadvertent disclosure of personal data may violate privacy laws, such as the EU's AVG. This can lead to significant fines and legal penalties.Identity theft:Disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and social security numbers can lead to identity theft and financial fraud.Damage to reputation:Both the reputation of the individuals whose information has been leaked and that of the organisation responsible for the leak can be seriously damaged.Loss of Trust:The confidence of the public and affected stakeholders in the organisation may decrease, leading to a decline in engagement and support.Personal Damage:Individuals may suffer emotional and psychological damage if their personal data, such as medical or financial information, is disclosed.Exploitation and Abuse:Disclosed data can be used for malicious purposes, such as strike, harassment or discrimination.Human monitoring helps to mitigate these risks by providing an additional layer of assessment and confirmation that anonymisation processes have been adequately carried out before information is made public.",Octobox Netherlands B.V.,,,,,,,Other algorithms,"1: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 2: Omgevingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037885. 3: Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht (AWB), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537. 4: Bekendmakingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004287. 5: Wet Open Overheid (WOO), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754. 6: Wet Elektronische Publicaties (WEP), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961",,,15443292

This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible.

At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists.The water board employee always does the final test of whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk.

This allows us to predict the effect on the environment and take action. Using image recognition on satellite images and analysis, changes in Natura 2000 areas, a European network of protected natural areas, are visualised and mapped in detail. This is done to support ecological purposes, such as nitrogen policy monitoring. The province of South Holland is monitored using various sensors (satellite images, LIDAR, IR, multispectral, microwave, etc.) from satellites, aircraft and helicopters.  Much of this data is available for free. Exploiting such area-wide measurement series can give a big boost to monitoring natural areas. Interpreting remote sensing data into ecologically relevant insights can be an important building block for a digital twin of nature. These measurement sets can serve as the 'skeleton' or framework on which the digital twin can be further built. Drone imagery, combined with species recognition, also provides a means of obtaining highly detailed data. This increases coverage and it allows for better updating within the province. Habitat biodiversity is lower than desired. At European level, it is stipulated that government agencies have the task of improving this in Natura 2000 areas. Using image recognition, changes in these areas are visualised and mapped in detail. This allows plant species to be recognised and monitored, for example to identify the spread of invasive species and take remedial measures against nitrogen. Within nature reserves, certain plant species are sensitive to nitrogen. Excess nitrogen causes these plant species to be displaced by other, less desirable species, such as nettle grasses. This process, such as grassing, can have negative consequences for the biodiversity of dune areas, for example. The resolution of the images is 50 to 30 centimetres of raw data from NSO, with aggregations up to 3-4 metres for ecological applications. There is no impact on people as they are not recognisable on the satellite images (subject to privacy check NSO).

For the departments responsible for handling Woo requests, the tool makes complying with laws and regulations easier and shortens turnaround time so that information can be offered within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low for individuals and organisations. The algorithm searches for (personal) data and flags or masks it, without making automatic decisions. A task expert evaluates the proposals for anonymisation. The tool also offers the option to manually mask information that cannot be disclosed, such as strategic information to protect the organisation or partners. The basis for anonymising or masking is provided by the tool.","Sometimes certain excerpts of text in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo provides bases for this, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG). Without tools, anonymising texts would be time-consuming and increase the risk of errors, which could lead to unwanted publication of sensitive data. Using an anonymisation tool speeds up and simplifies this process for both active and passive disclosure. Automated anonymisation is less error-prone than manual work. This reduces the risk of data leaks and better protects individuals' data.",General data protection regulation (AVG)Environment ActGeneral Administrative Law Act (AWB)Disclosure ActOpen Government Act (WOO)Electronic Publications Act (WEP),1.0,,waterschap@zuiderzeeland.nl,nld,,"Before commissioning, a setup document was prepared by the organisation and the supplier. This sets out the organisation's preferences for anonymisation. These preferences are combined with Octobox's Basic Model, which by default searches for data such as Citizen Service Numbers, bank account numbers, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, dates, residential addresses and postal codes.The organisation can choose not to anonymise certain names, such as those of ministers or directors, while other names are anonymised. Names of employees who are not in the Basic Model can be added in advance. The organisation can also specify how e-mail addresses are to be made unrecognisable.","The software searches documents based on smart rules and recognises personal data such as Citizen Service Numbers, bank account numbers, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, dates, residential addresses and postal codes.The software can be set to the degree of certainty with which data is recognised. Employees can see on the screen which text fragments should definitely be varnished and which are less certain. They can approve or reject the proposals and mark text for 'varnishing' (making it unrecognisable) themselves, including adding a basis for doing so.A second staff member can check the work of the first. Once all documents have been reviewed, the final version is made in a format suitable for publication.",Human intervention is always a requirement when using the software. This means that control is always carried out by co-workers. The organisation has prepared a setup document. This allows the organisation to adapt the use of algorithms to their specific situation. A subject matter expert evaluates proposals for anonymising texts. No automatic decisions are made.The algorithm searches for (personal) data and marks them. The subject specialist checks and corrects the proposals. This work can possibly be checked by a second person within the tool. This fulfils the requirement of 'human intervention'.,"To avoid documents not being properly anonymised, a human check always takes place. The software is intuitive to use for checking, changes or additions. Without human verification, risks may arise, such as disclosure of privacy-sensitive data. The combination of the tool and human verification helps prevent this.Violation of privacy laws:Inadvertent disclosure of personal data may violate privacy laws, such as the EU's AVG. This can lead to significant fines and legal penalties.Identity theft:Disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and social security numbers can lead to identity theft and financial fraud.Damage to reputation:Both the reputation of the individuals whose information has been leaked and that of the organisation responsible for the leak can be seriously damaged.Loss of trust:The confidence of the public and affected stakeholders in the organisation may decrease, leading to a decline in engagement and support.Personal damage:Individuals may suffer emotional and psychological damage if their personal data, such as medical or financial information, is made public.Exploitation and abuse:Disclosed data can be used for malicious purposes, such as strike, harassment or discrimination.Human monitoring helps to mitigate these risks by providing an extra layer of assessment and confirmation.

Therefore, privacy- or business-sensitive information must at least be varnished away. Before the algorithm was deployed, this deleting did not always go well. There were data breaches where not all personal data was deleted or where deleted information could still be read. The advantage of anonymisation software is that anonymisation is faster and better. The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server. The content is not stored on this server, so the privacy risk of using the algorithm does not outweigh the privacy benefit of reducing the number of data breaches due to improper anonymisation.",1.

At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8. Minimum key figures for the accuracy of identifying personal data are as follows: Named entities (precision): 0.78, Named entities (recall): 0.76, Named entities (F-score): 0.77.

It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists.The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

This per location with energy consumption from 50,000 kWh electricity or 25,000 m3 natural gas equivalent. The energy savings obligation obliges these parties to implement energy-saving measures. The energy saving information obligation obliges these parties to report on this. Reporting must be done in a central, national digital counter. This desk is managed by the Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO). Formally, reports are submitted to the local competent authority (municipalities, provinces). Via the basic task package, supervision and enforcement of these duties are the responsibility of the environmental services. The reported data are therefore made available to the competent authority and the environment services without delay. The aforementioned single private individual is then the owner of a building that he rents out to a company or social institution. Then an information and energy-saving obligation applies to building measures. This concerns about 200 sites reported by a private individual out of a total of about 50,000 sites currently reported.The information obligation is attached to the energy savings obligation in 2019 to enable information-driven supervision. Information-driven supervision means that environment services will be the first to inspect businesses that are least compliant with the energy savings obligation.A company or social institutions meets the energy saving obligation by implementing all applicable measures from the Approved Measures List for Energy Saving (EML). A company ticks off in the digital counter which measures have or have not yet been implemented, and which are not applicable. Based on these answers, a classification code is generated.

Camera surveillance has several functions.- Camera surveillance increases the efficiency and effectiveness of action by police, municipal enforcement officers and emergency services. It helps police, enforcement and supervisors to get to the scene faster;- In addition, camera surveillance works preventively: it helps prevent public order problems and criminal offences. - Camera surveillance also has a repressive function: police and judicial authorities can use the camera images for investigation purposes;- Finally, camera surveillance makes citizens and entrepreneurs feel safer.Anyone entering a camera surveillance area must be clearly informed of this. This is done by placing signs and informing local residents and entrepreneurs in the area concerned. The decision in which the mayor announces the designation of a camera surveillance area is published.The recorded camera images are viewed live and/or stored. Live viewing is done only on the days and times when it is necessary, under the direction of the police. The police is the only authority that has free access to the servers where the images are stored. The municipality itself does not have access to the servers. The cameras are always on but the images are not always viewed live. ","Mayors can designate areas for public order enforcement where camera surveillance takes place for a certain period of time. Camera surveillance is used to make public spaces safer. Cameras monitor nightlife areas, shopping centres and areas of high nuisance or crime. Camera surveillance allows the municipality, together with the police, to act quickly when necessary.

Training dates: Marine siteThis dataset contains images from four cameras in the Marineterrein area. It involves several hundred images per camera. The number of people in the images varies from 0 to about 200. The cameras used for these images were hanging at the Marineterrein at a height of 3 to 15 metres during data collection.Training dates: ArenaThis dataset contains images from four cameras in the Arena area. It involves about 300 annotated images per camera. The number of people in the images ranges from 0 to 100. The cameras used for these images were hanging around the Amsterdam Arena at 10 to 15 metres height during data collection.Training data: Dam datasetThis dataset contains about 1,000 images of Dam Square in Amsterdam. All these images were shot from the same location at the same angle. They are ""stitched"" images: the images from four different cameras have been merged into a single image. These images show between 0 and 200 people, and the circumstances are always very different. Think: weather conditions, lighting, time of day, reflections in the lens due to sunlight.Training dates: Shanghaitech Crowd CountingThese sets contain annotations showing the locations of people's heads in the image.'Shanghaitech Part A' This dataset contains 482 images of large groups of people (an average of 501.4 per image). These images were randomly collected from the internet. 'Shanghaitech Part B' This dataset contains 716 images of groups of people (average 123.6 per image), captured by several cameras in the city of Shanghai, with different viewing angles.The Municipality of Amsterdam did not collect the images from the Shanghaitech Crowd Counting dataset itself. They are freely available via the internet. This dataset is only used for training purposes.","Description of the system architectureA camera takes video images of a given area. The video images are sent -protected by end-to-end encryption- to a local server. The algorithm analyses how many people are in the images. That number is sent to an overview page (dashboard) for the municipality's operational staff, so that they have an accurate picture of the crowds at the moment. Currently, only the crowds at the Marineterrein location are shown, in the future also for the other Public Eye locations. The video images do not leave the server and are not stored. A very limited number of images are kept only for training purposes, these are encrypted. Personal data is processed according to the applicable laws and regulations (AVG) and the Transparency Guide (TADA). A specific privacy statement accompanies this project. The locations and functions of the cameras are included in the Amsterdam municipality's camera register. Performance The algorithm needs to be about 70 per cent accurate to extract relevant insights to regulate traffic. In practice, the algorithm delivers about 90 per cent accuracy. We derive this from the training images. Besides operational functioning, this project is constantly innovating. We are constantly looking for new functionalities that can improve the system: One of the ambitions is to build the system even more privacy-friendly, and we are doing so by adding a model that makes it possible to train the algorithm with fewer images per camera. This is called the ViCCT model. We want to have the analysis performed on the sensor (the ""on edge"" technique).","Using the training data, the quality and accuracy of the algorithm is periodically evaluated by a small number of municipal employees who have permission to view the images. They review whether the algorithm is justified in recognising people as humans.","The video footage used by Public Eye is deleted - once the algorithm has counted the number of people present. A small number of video images are kept only for training the model (about 300 images per location). The images are on the municipal infrastructure that complies with the Baseline Information Security Government (https://www.informatiebeveiligingsdienst.nl/project/baseline-informatiebeveiliging-overheid). If the images were to fall into the wrong hands unanonymised, the risk of a breach of privacy is relatively low: the camera is at such a high altitude that it is difficult to recognise people on the images. In addition, data minimisation is practised: the cameras in the ArenA area are only switched on from two hours prior to an event until the event is over. At other times, Public Eye's cameras in the ArenA area are off. Work is underway to also turn off Public Eye's cameras at the other locations at times when these cameras are not necessary, for example at night. To keep Amsterdammers as well informed as possible, a sticker with a unique ID code is attached to each camera so that you can retrace the purpose of the camera on maps.amsterdam.nl/privacy. In this case, it's only counting cameras.

This can lead to significant fines and legal penalties.Identity theft:Disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and social security numbers can lead to identity theft and financial fraud.Damage to reputation:Both the reputation of the individuals whose information has been leaked and that of the organisation responsible for the leak can be seriously damaged.Loss of Trust:The confidence of the public and affected stakeholders in the organisation may decrease, leading to a decline in engagement and support.Personal Damage:Individuals may suffer emotional and psychological damage if their personal data, such as medical or financial information, is disclosed.Exploitation and Abuse:Disclosed data can be used for malicious purposes, such as strike, harassment or discrimination.Human monitoring helps to mitigate these risks by providing an additional layer of assessment and confirmation that anonymisation processes have been adequately carried out before information is made public.",Octobox Netherlands B.V.,,,,2022-03,,,Other algorithms,"1: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 2: Omgevingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037885. 3: Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht (AWB), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537. 4: Bekendmakingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004287. 5: Wet Open Overheid (WOO), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754. 6: Wet Elektronische Publicaties (WEP), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961",,,42827418

Scales: This calculation method involves one calculation depending on the scale in which the base falls. This calculation method is applied when there are several calculation rules, of which only one can always be applicable. If the base is between the minimum and maximum, this scale is used. For the calculation, the base is rounded. The factor and base amount can be either positive or negative. Slices: Under this calculation method, a calculation is performed for each bracket, for that part of the base that falls within the bracket. This calculation method is applied when a graduated calculation is needed. If part of the base is between the minimum and maximum, then that part of the base is used to calculate this tranche. For the calculation, the base is rounded. The factor and base amount can be either positive or negative. After the calculation, the amount is rounded. After rounding, it is checked whether the amount is between the minimum and maximum amount. If the amount is higher than the maximum, then the maximum is used.

This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8.

The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm. The last remaining risk is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has implemented privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

Smart ICT solutions offer new opportunities to finely link up-to-date traffic information to real-time shipping information via sensors and algorithms.   Of these 100 bridges, 55 have sensors that monitor whether the bridge is open or closed. For an ever-increasing number of these bridges, the province faces a challenge to optimally match traffic flow with shipping and increasing traffic density. The province is committed to smarter, safer and more efficient passage to meet these challenges.   In this, the 'Impact Monitor Bridge Openings' project has taken a substantial step in predicting traffic intensities around a number of important bridges in the province of South Holland. The Long Short-Term Memory neural networks used can make predictions up to 21 minutes ahead with a correlation coefficient accuracy of 75-95%. The developed algorithms were deployed within an Azure cloud environment. It has been delivered as a user-friendly web application in which live shipping and traffic information is presented. This information is used by the application to recommend the optimal time for a bridge opening to a bridge operator.  In a next phase, this information can be fed directly back to the traffic network which, for example, allows navigation software to take into account planned bridge openings. In summary, the developed web application uses recent technology in the field of artificial intelligence that allows bridge operators to combine expert knowledge with the latest technology.The Impact Monitor Bridge Openings is built to support bridge operators in choosing the optimal time for a bridge opening. The application is equipped to predict traffic volumes up to 21 minutes ahead in combination with up-to-date vessel traffic information. The Impact Monitor Bridge Openings is adapted to the behaviour and work process of bridge operators. In the application, the bridge operator sees 3 time slots of 7 minutes at a bridge. The app calculates in which of the three time periods a bridge opening causes the least inconvenience to road traffic. The bridge operator then makes the decision on when and how long to open the bridge.","The algorithm does not process any personal data (such as age, gender, income, health, and so on). The information is in no way traceable to a natural person. Moreover, there is always human intervention and the bridge operator still ultimately decides at what time a bridge is best opened.

Only a subset of these loops is accessed real-time to the NDW (National Database on Road Traffic Data) - the rest is used for monitoring and evaluation. As not all measurement loops relevant to the project were available in NDW, a raw dataset was requested from the supplier for the three bridges mentioned in the introduction. This contained the most detailed data of all vehicles travelling over a measurement loop, where each line in the dataset ́is a vehicle.

Deep learning algorithm Traffic intensity model development Deep learning models are developed in the Keras library (version 2.2.4), an open-source neural network package written in Python. Keras allows researchers to quickly experiment with deep neural networks. Keras had been used in conjunction with TensorFlow (version 1.5.0) as a backend using the GPU variant of the chosen model (section 3) in the experimental phase. A grid-search had been applied parsed from the Scikit-learn machine learning library for Python. All analyses for data cleaning and traffic intensity modelling were performed in Python. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a set of algorithms inspired by the hugely efficient functioning of the human brain to recognise patterns. An ANN consists of artificial neurons and in recent years can be trained to far depth and complexity efficiently by so-called deep learning algorithms. For time-series data such as in this case study, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often a suitable solution because here neurons not only factor in information from previous layers of the network, but also include information from previous time points. A powerful variant of RNNs is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which was developed specifically to model long time series. In the work presented here, LSTM was chosen as the final algorithm to predict real-time traffic intensities for three bridges. First, an LSTM model was trained on historical traffic data where a time series of inputs was used to predict a vector of steps ahead (script 1). In the second, an encoder-decoder LSTM was used (script 2) where the input time series of data is encoded (encode). The decoder uses this encoded data and makes a prediction one step ahead for each element in the output sequence. The difference is small, as in practice both models predict one sequence ahead. The main difference is that an LSTM model encoder decoder model has information about both the previous step predicted and also the accumulated information from the encoder step is taken into account in predicting the output sequence",The algorithm itself is only decision support.

Payroll tax risk model - Monitoring correct qualification of employment relationships (TKA),Dutch Tax and Customs Administration,This algorithm Supervision of correct qualification of labour relations (TKA) is part of the risk model Payroll Taxes.

Payroll taxes are taxes and contributions that companies withhold as employers (wage tax and national insurance contributions) and pay on their employees' wages (employee insurance contributions and income-dependent health insurance contributions). The Payroll Tax Risk Model helps Tax and Customs Administration staff monitor proper compliance with legislation relevant to payroll taxes. The TKA algorithm is designed to detect the use of additional workers who are not employees. ,"When there is false self-employment, for example, no payroll taxes are wrongly paid. For example, false self-employment may occur when a company (as a principal) uses hired workers who actually work for this company in a dependent and/or subordinate relationship, which actually constitutes employment (working as an employee).Sham self-employment has the following adverse consequences, among others:The sham self-employed person is less well protected than if this person had been an employee.The pseudo self-employed person can make unjustified use of corporate tax schemes.The client pays too little payroll taxes.Competition with companies (which do use salaried staff) is distorted.For these reasons, the Tax Authority intensifies supervision of the correct qualification of employment relationships. The algorithm TKA combines different types of data to detect indications of situations where there is third-party hiring. Based on these indications, clients can be contacted for additional questions to determine whether an investigation should be launched into the qualification of labour relations.This algorithm allows the Tax and Customs Administration to use its limited supervisory capacity more efficiently. The use of the algorithm increases the chances of approaching the right client for an interview or investigation. The use of the algorithm will allow supervision to be carried out more efficiently and effectively than when detection and selection were done manually.Through the results from the algorithm, the Tax Administration can also act proactively through, for example, additional education.

The conditions of the Audit Service Rijk (ADR) are leading in this respect. When changes are made to one of the algorithms, the Tax and Customs Administration checks whether the algorithms still meet the quality requirements.The use of the relevant data is tested against the relevant legislation.

Care profile algorithm,CIZ Centre for Healthcare Indication,The algorithm helps the CIZ employee choose the care profile that best suits the client's care needs. A care profile states what care a person needs.,Health and Healthcare,,In use,The algorithm is a tool for the CIZ employee to choose the most appropriate care profile for the client. This involves how much and what care is granted.Support from the algorithm helps the CIZ to issue the same care profile in similar situations.,The algorithm is in use to also assign similar type and amount of care in similar situations.The algorithm supports the staff making the decision.This is also a moment of reflection for the employees. They test whether the image they have of the situation and the recorded file correspond to the outcome of the algorithm.,The Long-Term Care Act (Wlz) describes the criteria for access to care from the Wlz and the role of the CIZ to examine this (indication). The care profiles are described in the Regeling langdurige zorg (Rlz) ,1.0,,https://www.ciz.nl/hulp-en-contact#contact,nld,,The CIZ employee does research and fills in scores for the client's severity of disorders and impairments. The algorithm uses these scores and makes a calculation to determine which care profiles fit best. The algorithm can do this because it has been trained on lots of past decisions that have taught it which care profile best fits a combination of scores.,"The client's functioning and care needs are identified by the staff member during the indication examination. The findings of the examination are recorded by completing a questionnaire on impairment and (functional) limitations scoring. These questions are grouped into nine domains of self-reliance, and a scale score is calculated on each of these domains. The algorithm calculates from these scale scores, through weighting coefficients and cut-off values, which care profile fits best and which is the best alternative thereafter. Both are shown with their own percentage 'correctness'.The weighting coefficients and cut-off values come from a regression analysis performed on historical data. There is no automatic adjustment of these values based on new data. Thus, the algorithm is not self-learning. This means that the CIZ can always explain on the basis of which logic the algorithm arrived at the advice.","The CIZ employee first determines whether there is access to the Long-Term Care Act (Wlz). Once access is determined, the most appropriate care profile is chosen. The algorithm helps choose which care profile best suits the situation, i.e. how much and what kind of care is appropriate.The algorithm shows the best-fit care profile and the best-fit alternative, after which the staff member decides whether one of these two proposed care profiles is appropriate or whether the staff member thinks another care profile is a better fit after all.","CIZ processes sensitive personal information and is aware of the potential risks involved. Therefore, this algorithm does not use personal data such as name, address or data on ethnicity. Thus, the algorithm only looks at filled data on health status.The employee makes the decision, not the algorithm. This staff member is familiar with the content of the different care profiles and and, based on his professionalism, has the ability to make a choice other than the care profile suggested by the algorithm.To assess the performance of the algorithm, the algorithm was reassessed after some time.

However, if additional data, checks or actions are required, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There, it is checked by a civil affairs employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve an application/declaration. Only the civil affairs officer can reject an application/declaration.The impact is that such an application can be dealt with efficiently by the municipality; after all, a resident/company has already carried out several steps (work), leaving the official more time for the special and/or complicated declarations/applications the municipality receives. In some cases, this application can even be processed fully automatically.

",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation tool is used to give substance to transparency on the one hand and the necessary protection of the individuals, companies and institutions to whom documents relate on the other.Transparency because it enables the organisation to share information according to regulations such as the Woo, either actively or passively. For citizens about whom there is data in documents to be published, the use means that there is no privacy violation and the organisation thus complies with the AVG. The same applies to the protection of privacy data of the organisation's employees.The applicant of a Woo request receives the information she asked for, either in anonymised version or partially masked on a different basis. For the departments within the organisation responsible for handling a Woo request and/or publishing information, it means complying with laws and regulations. Use of the software reduces turnaround time and therefore contributes to being able to provide requested information within the legal deadlines.The risk impact of the algorithm is low. This applies to individuals (citizens, employees of buying organisations) and companies and institutions. The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and masks or indicates them regardless of the further content of documents. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to a subject person, there are no automatic decisions. In addition, the tool has the option of manually masking information that cannot be made public for other reasons. With this, for example, a text fragment containing strategic information can be marked to protect one's own organisation or a partner organisation (government, company or institution). The basis for anonymising or masking is indicated in the box.","It happens that text excerpts in documents made public cannot be shared with the public. The Woo has provided Foundations on the basis of which that is possible. And the AVG is also such a basis for non-Woo publications. Without the use of the software, anonymising text fragments in documents would take significantly more time. The use of the anonymisation tool speeds up and simplifies the process for active and passive disclosure. Automated anonymisation is also less error-prone than human intervention.

Staff names may be missing from the Basic Model and added in advance. Another preference the organisation may indicate is, for example, the format in which an e-mail address is made unrecognisable.","Based on smart rules, the software searches through the texts of every document in the offered file. Certain texts, words or character combinations are recognised as traceable data, such as Citizen Service Numbers, Bank Account Numbers, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, dates, residential addresses and postal codes.The software can be set to the degree of certainty in which a condition is met. For the employee, the screen indicates which text fragments should be varnished with certainty, and which meet the established smart rule to a lesser extent. Through the screen, the employee can approve or reject the proposals, and also amend for approval. The collaborator can also mark text itself and make it eligible for varnishing, including adding a basis. It is possible for a second collaborator to check the work of the first. Once all (pages of all) documents in the file have been reviewed, the final version is created, in a suitable format for publication.","Human intervention and control is always the norm in use. The software works on the basis of a setup document. Through this setup document and various mechanisms, the organisation can tailor/parameterise algorithm use to its own unique situation. A proposal is made for anonymising a text fragment to a subject person. No automated decisions are involved. The algorithm searches specifically for (personal) data and marks or designates it regardless of further document content. The subject matter person handles the suggestions and indicates where they are correct, corrects where it should. If necessary, this work can also be reviewed within the software by a second person. For the citizen, this means that the organisation is working demonstrably and proportionately to eliminate (the risk of) privacy violations and thus comply with the AVG.","To mitigate the risk of documents being insufficiently anonymised, human verification always takes place. This involves full control where the software can be used intuitively to check or modify/enrich. If no human control were to take place when anonymising documents, various risks may arise, especially due to disclosure or publication of privacy-sensitive data. This tool in conjunction with humans, helps prevent this:Violation of privacy laws:The inadvertent disclosure of personal data may violate privacy laws, such as the EU's AVG. This can lead to significant fines and legal penalties.Identity theft:Disclosing personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses and social security numbers can lead to identity theft and financial fraud.Damage to reputation:Both the reputation of the individuals whose information has been leaked and that of the organisation responsible for the leak can be seriously damaged.Loss of Trust:The confidence of the public and affected stakeholders in the organisation may decrease, leading to a decline in engagement and support.Personal Damage:Individuals may suffer emotional and psychological damage if their personal data, such as medical or financial information, is disclosed.Exploitation and Abuse:Disclosed data can be used for malicious purposes, such as strike, harassment or discrimination.Human monitoring helps to mitigate these risks by providing an additional layer of assessment and confirmation that anonymisation processes have been adequately carried out before information is made public.",Octobox Netherlands B.V.,,,,,,,Other algorithms,"1: Algemene verordening gegevensbescherming (AVG), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 2: Omgevingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0037885. 3: Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht (AWB), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537. 4: Bekendmakingswet, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004287. 5: Wet Open Overheid (WOO), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754. 6: Wet Elektronische Publicaties (WEP), https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961",,,93536918
Zivver,Municipality of Smallingerland,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,privacy@smallingerland.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor. If it turns out that the algorithm is making incorrect classifications more often, this is picked up by the monitoring so that adjustments to the algorithm can be made.

Risk equalisation,"Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport","Due to the underwriting obligation, a health insurer may incur higher healthcare costs if it has a proportionately higher number of insured who need a lot of care.

This is stipulated in the Health Insurance Act. That law also stipulates that the premium charged by the health insurer for such health insurance may not be tailored to the health risk or other characteristics of the insured. Without further measures, the consequence of the underwriting obligation and the prohibition of premium differentiation is that health insurers with a relatively large number of unhealthy policyholders in their health insurance portfolio are at a disadvantage compared to health insurers with a relatively healthy population, because, given their population, they are forced to charge a higher premium than their competitor with a healthier population. This inequality, created by differences in the risk profile of the insured portfolio, undermines the level playing field on which competition between health insurers should take place.

Dynamic Cable Model,Liander N.V.,"The dynamic cable model is a model that can accurately calculate cable temperatures of medium- and high-voltage cables in changing conditions. Here, environmental situations such as ground temperature, soil moisture and load profile can be dynamic over time, allowing realistic situations for cables to be calculated. ",Space and Infrastructure,,In use," Anno 2024, there is a lot of congestion on the electricity grid. More and more customers want to electrify, which puts enormous pressure on electricity grids that are not designed for this. National and regional grid operators are therefore looking for the space we have on the electricity grid what we already maintain. With this model, the dynamic cable load capacity (maximum load capacity) can be determined. By taking into account the anonymised and aggregated load profiles of our customers and the environmental variables of our power grid, we can ensure that we can connect more customers during the energy transition. The dynamic cable load capacity can be much higher than the load capacity set by the grid operator's policy or by the cable manufacturer, because it is not based on generic conservative values, but on the actual situation. This model has been developed to allow the grid operator to deviate from their conservative standards so that more customers can be connected to the grid.",Use of this product supports the organisation within its digitalisation strategy and allows us to remotely determine whether we can connect more customers to the grid based on physical models. This allows us to minimise the deployment of expensive sensor solutions and enable the energy transition within accepted and substantiated financial and safety risks.  ,,1.0,,algoritmes@alliander.com,nld,,"The dynamic cable model uses various data sources to make calculations. The data is retrieved at the moment a user wants to do a calculation and the model then uses the most recently available data. The dynamic cable model uses the following data sources in its calculations:1. ERA5 Weather Data - an open dataset storing real-time weather information.2. BOFEK2012 subsurface model - an open dataset containing soil physical characteristics of soils throughout the Netherlands.3. LHM groundwater model - the national hydrological model is an open dataset and provides information on various characteristics of groundwater in the Netherlands.4. Liander Asset Data - dataset from Liander that includes assets placed in the Netherlands. Used to see what type of cable is in which place, for example.","The input data mentioned in the Data section are converted by logic and physical calculations into the maximum cable load capacity based on the temperature of the cable. Using information about a power cable and information about external factors affecting the temperature evolution of power cables, the model calculates the temperature a cable reaches when a given amount of current flows through the cable. Relevant information about the cable includes, for example, its length and material. Examples of external factor information are weather information and information about the soil composition where the cable is located. This external information determines how fast a cable heats up given the conditions it is in, which allows us to run more current through the cable than the prescribed maximum. A simple example is: In winter, the ground is colder, so cables heat up less quickly and more current can flow through them.  ","Humans always make the choice about what is done with the outcome of the model. Specialists with knowledge of the grid use this model to input data and ask for an outcome, with this they then do/do not work further depending on the outcome. There is always a human making the decisions based on the model's calculations.  ","Risk management for the DKM algorithm consists of several components: the safe limits it computes with; human intervention; logging of inputs and outputs; and audits are performed on the algorithm.Safe limitsLiander's policy defines limits within which the algorithm makes calculations. The algorithm also gives more general advice when the little information is provided and more specific results when more information is provided, the results always remain within the set safe margins. This ensures that unsafe situations cannot arise due to calculation errors.Human interventionIn addition, it is not automated decision-making, a specialist enters data, with this the algorithm makes a calculation. Then the specialist looks at the outcome and if/how to proceed with it. The specialist has knowledge of the grid and can therefore determine not to use an outcome. So this model cannot autonomously cause errors in the grid, there is always a person with specialist knowledge in between who uses the model's output.LoggingAll data entered into the algorithm as input is stored, this way we can, if necessary, reason back to what a particular outcome is based on.AuditsAn internal audit was carried out on the algorithm in order to identify possible risks of deploying it. The conclusion of this is that the model is soundly designed, partly because of the clear documentation of components that are or are not included and what their impact is. They also mention that the validation of the calculations is well set up, and that the validation of the reliability of the inputs is thorough and well documented.Finally, the underlying systems used are patched in a timely manner to prevent unauthorised access.",,,,,2022-01,,,Impactful algorithms,,,"1: LHM, https://nhi.nu/modellen/lhm/#:~:text=Het%20Landelijk%20Hydrologisch%20Model%20is,in%20verschillende%20overwegend%20landelijke%20studies.. . 2: ERA5 weerdata, https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview. 3: BOFEK2012, https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/bofek2012-de-nieuwe-bodemfysische-schematisatie-van-nederland",12678378
Personal Impact Analysis - Intangible damage,Groningen Mining Damage Institute,"At the IMG, there is the Intangible Damage Scheme (IMS), where people can receive compensation if they have suffered stress, anxiety or other psychological symptoms due to the earthquakes. For IMS, applicants can fill in a questionnaire (the personal impact analysis (PIA)) to describe the impact of the earthquakes on them.","Law, Health and Healthcare, Nature and Environment",https://www.schadedoormijnbouw.nl/regelingen/immateriele-schadevergoeding,In use,"Purpose: The PIA is used by the IMG to determine how much (mental) harm a person has suffered from the earthquakes. This is important for the compensation an applicant should receive. Completing the PIA questionnaire is not mandatory when making an application. Moreover, the outcome of the PIA can only lead to equal or higher compensation. Impact: The PIA has an effect on the amount of compensation. Each answer to a question from the PIA list is given a score. Based on all the scores from the PIA questionnaire, a so-called PIA profile is created. This PIA profile can make a claimant entitled to more compensation. Sometimes claimants may find the PIA intense, as they are reminded of the feelings of fear and terror they experienced during or after an earthquake.","Benefits:The PIA makes it possible to assess individual casesThe PIA does justice to an individual claimant's situationThe PIA allows a claimant to describe his personal situation and the impact it has made on him in his application for immaterial damages.Disadvantages:The PIA has to be completed by the applicant himself.

For each question, an applicant can choose between a number of response options. These options indicate the extent to which the situation from the question applies to the applicant. There are different answer options for each subset of questions. In general terms, the options range from 'not at all' or 'never' to 'almost every day' or 'constantly'. Questions from a PIA deal with depression or anxiety, for example. A score is associated with each response option. These scores can be found in a table in Microsoft Excel. With a fully completed PIA questionnaire, the scores of all answer options are added together. This addition determines an applicant's PIA score. That PIA score then determines whether and to what extent the compensation to be paid should be increased.","The outcome of the PIA affects the amount of compensation an applicant is entitled to in an IMS application. The outcome of the PIA can only ensure equal or higher compensation, never lower compensation. The PIA contains a number of questions and statements, the applicant has to give a mark for each question or statement. The mark 1 means the applicant does not agree with the statement at all or the situation does not apply to the applicant, 5 means the applicant agrees with the statement or the situation does apply to the applicant. A score is assigned to each answer from the PIA. These scores are added together. The sum of the scores determines whether and how much the applicant is entitled to an increase in compensation. The scores are always copied, so no human verification takes place. No human verification is needed either, because the PIA score is really just a sum of the answers someone gives while filling in the PIA.

The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible.

Identity matching in the BRP-Coupling Point,National Authority for Identity Data,The search algorithm used by the BRP Link Point to determine whether a person logging in with an eIDAS resource already appears in the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP).,Organisation and business operations,https://www.rvig.nl/logisch-ontwerp-brpk,In use,"In digital government services within the Netherlands, the citizen service number (in combination with DigiD) is used to establish a reliable link between the person logging in and the person in the service provider's database. In digital services within Europe, this works in a similar way, but slightly differently.A citizen can log in to the digital services of the Dutch government with a notified eIDAS device. With that login, the Dutch government agency is provided with a set of identifying data to determine who that citizen is. With that set of identifying data, a ""Uniqueness ID"" is also provided by the country issuing the eIDAS resource. At the first contact, the service provider must determine, based on the identifying data received, whether the citizen already exists in the database or is a new customer. We call this process 'identity matching'. The service provider is supposed to store the Uniqueness ID for use in subsequent contacts.Performing error-free identity matching is non-trivial. The identity data sent along by the other EU country may differ from the data registered in the Netherlands. For example, the different spellings of diacritics (Müller/Mueller) or double sounds (Tchaikovsky/Tchaikovsky/Chaikovsky). This can lead to different types of errors; the person is mistakenly not recognised as a new client registered when there was already a registration under a different name, or vice versa: the person is mistakenly linked to another person with a somewhat similar name.In the Netherlands, the choice was made to perform this important and error-prone step in the service provision process centrally, so that not all individual government organisations have to do it themselves. This avoids duplication and errors. The facility designed for this purpose is called the BRP Interface Point. In the BRP-Point, Identity Matching is performed by a combination of a comparison algorithm, combined with manual assessment by experts. The comparison algorithm is based on the Intelligent Search in the BSN Management facility - Rijksdienst voor Identiteitsgegevens (overheid.nl).","If an intelligent search algorithm were not deployed, the matching of persons would take place on the basis of a 1-to-1 comparison of the search data entered with the personal data in the database. However, experience shows that the personal data provided by the other EU country do not always match exactly with the data present in the Dutch basic register. For example, many organisations do not have the full first names of the person, but only the initials, or only the first name in full. It is also common that diacritical marks such as ã, â, ä or ligatures such as Ӕ are not registered or not registered correctly. Furthermore, there are many different spellings in circulation of (especially) foreign names. In a 1-to-1 comparison, these search queries would wrongly lead to the answer Not Found; we call this a false negative result. The person who logs in with his eIDAS credential and is already registered in the Basic Registration of Persons in the Netherlands with a BSN will then not be recognised. This will certainly lead to problems with the requested service. Introducing some form of intelligent search in this case increases the hit probability, thus reducing the false negative rate.  At the same time, such a search algorithm may increase the likelihood of false positives by finding persons who do not meet the intended search query. This may lead to linking a logged-in person to another person's BSN. This situation should be avoided as much as possible.When weighing up the advantages against the disadvantages, we chose to add measures that exclude the occurrence of a false-positive result as much as possible. This creates a balance between preventing false negatives without simultaneously increasing the percentage of false positives too much.","The legal basis for the process is the eIDAS regulation. In the Netherlands, the eIDAS regulation is implemented by the EU Electronic Identities and Trust Services Implementation Act.",1.0,,info@rvig.nl,nld,,The set of data used by the algorithm is determined by the data that may be exchanged within eIDAS for Identity Matching.

Therefore, the UniquenessID and attributes are forwarded to the BRP Link Point. On subsequent logins, the match made between the UniquenessID and the (encrypted) BSN is reused. Identity matching then does not have to be done again;The BRP-Point queries the extended set of identifying data:If there is no answer, the Identity Matching process cannot be performed, and the requested service is refused. After all, the BSN is needed for the requested service in this case;If the requested data is provided, then a request follows for the user to voluntarily provide her BSN;If exactly 1 person is found in the BRP and the BSN matches the BSN provided, the match is recorded;If exactly 1 person is found and the user has not provided a BSN, the user is asked to confirm the last three digits of the BSN found. This question is asked to prevent a false-positive match;If the user does not confirm the BSN found, then no match follows;If the user confirms the BSN and the first names are not exactly the same, a manual check follows for extra assurance that it is actually the same person;Similarly, if more than one person is found and the user has not provided a BSN, a manual check follows.The search engine uses the following rules when searching for possible matches:The following translations are performed on both sides (the supplied and the registered BRP data):Diacritical characters (à á â ã ä ā ă ė ä å ç ő ą ě) are removed;Special characters (Æ æ Đ đ Ħ ħ ı ĸ Ŀ ŀ Ł ł Ŋ ŋ ŉ Ø Œ œ ß Þ þ Ŧ ŧ Ĳ ij) are converted according to ICAO rules for the machine-readable strip of the identity document;Upper case letters shall be converted to lower case;Any character other than a..z or 0..9 is replaced by &lt;space&gt;;All &lt;spaces&gt; are removed;Phonetic equivalents are converted to a code(longest first): TE_1: v w TE_2: a ae TE_3: tsch sch tch ch zj zh sh ch sj jh kh x sTE_4: schtsch sj ch chtch scTE_5: i j yTE_6: oe ou yu ue o uMultiple equal characters in succession are replaced by 1 character;Remaining characters ""h"" are deleted.","Human intervention takes place the moment the matching process finds two or more possible hits in the BRP and the logged-in user has not entered (the last three digits of) the BSN. In such a case, the logged-in user receives a message on the screen that a manual search is started and that he or she should try again later. Specialised data managers then assess the results and determine whether a match can be made between the logged-in person and an existing registration in the BRP. If so, this link is made manually and the person can then proceed with the requested service.","The matching process is monitored and a front office is available where eIDAS users can report with questions and any problems. In the unlikely event that a person is linked to someone else's registration, a system function is available that allows the data manager to manually break this link.The underlying search algorithm is designed to be easily adapted and refined.

Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor.

Risk-based prioritisation of data breach notifications,Dutch Data Protection Authority,"The AP uses this algorithm to classify data breach reports by severity. Based on that classification, inspectors can prioritise serious reports. The algorithm does not contain any personal data. ",Law,https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/datalek-melden,In use,"The AP's supervision of the data breach notification requirement is risk-based. Some data breach reports are so serious that AP inspectors have to pick them up urgently. To determine the severity of a data breach, the AP looks at the risk of harm faced by the victims of the data breach. The higher the risk, the sooner and the more intensively inspectors deal with the data breach notification. The AP has drawn up a number of criteria to ensure that inspectors handle data breaches with serious consequences as a matter of urgency.","Data breaches can have serious consequences for victims. Therefore, an organisation that has a data breach must act quickly: quickly plug the data breach and also quickly warn victims of the consequences of the data breach. In addition, the organisation must report the data breach to the AP within 72 hours. This reporting obligation allows the AP to check whether the organisation handles the data breach carefully. The AP receives around 20,000 data breach reports per year. In order to be able to pick up the reports of the most serious data breaches urgently and to make optimal use of the AP's available capacity, prioritisation of data breach reports is necessary. An algorithm is used to determine this prioritisation. This is a simple algorithm in which various characteristics of a data breach notification are weighted. The operation of the algorithm is easy for inspectors to understand: it is easy to see why a particular report has or has not been given a high priority. In doing so, the AP does not use personal data, nor does it result in an immediate automatic decision.  ","

Educational outcomes models PO and VO,Inspectorate of Education,"The algorithm calculates the educational outcomes of schools (cluster, branch, programme).

Educational outcomes are a consequence of educational quality. Education that is not good enough leads to educational outcomes that are not good enough. Inspectors use the educational outcomes models when assessing learning outcomes/educational results (as referred to in the WPO, WVO and the Regulations Learning Outcomes PO and VO). With the educational outcomes model, we calculate whether the school succeeds in having pupils achieve sufficient learning outcomes. To do this, we use an average of the learning results of pupils at school. Using the so-called school weighting measure for primary education and the APCG score for secondary education (both calculated by Statistics Netherlands), we also include the characteristics of the entire group of pupils at school. This allows us to take into account the complexity of the pupil population when assessing educational outcomes (see references under the heading 'links to data sources', for more information). A school's calculated educational outcomes are insufficient if they fall below the set standard as described in the Regulations on Learning Outcomes for PO and VO. When a school is selected for examination, the inspector will give a judgement on the standard Results on the basis of the calculated educational results: if the school believes that the calculated educational results do not properly reflect the pupils' learning outcomes, the school can submit its own justification. Through this own justification, the judgement on educational outcomes can still become satisfactory or be described as not assessable. If an inspector judges the educational results to be unsatisfactory during the investigation, the school is given one or more remedial orders. ","The advantage of using an algorithm that calculates educational outcomes at a school is that educational outcomes are calculated in the same way for all schools using the same legal requirements. A second advantage is that it avoids having to determine scores manually. A disadvantage is that not all specific characteristics of the pupil population can be captured in the model. In such cases, the school can provide its own justification.","Education Supervision Act (WOT), Secondary Education Act (WVO), Primary Education Act (WPO), Regulations Learning Outcomes PO and VO",1.0,,https:://www.onderwijsinspectie.nl/contact,nld,,"The primary sources are the so-called 1-digit files containing (among other things) the educational results achieved per pupil/student.

The rules are laid down in the Regulations Learning Outcomes PO and VO. In PO, two indicators are calculated, one of which is corrected for the school weighting, a measure of the complexity of the pupil population. Both indicators are calculated over three years, taking the weighted average based on pupil numbers. When one or both indicators are below the (corrected) standard, the calculated assessment is unsatisfactory. When both indicators are above the norm, the calculated opinion is sufficient. In VO, four indicators are calculated, each with its own standard. Indicators are calculated by averaging over three years. Corrections are made for three of the four indicators, depending on the background and support needs of pupils at a school. When two of the four indicators are below the norm, the calculated assessment is insufficient.","A school's calculated educational results are insufficient if they fall below the set standard as described in the Regulations on Educational Results for PO and VO. The judgement on educational outcomes is given only after an investigation at the school. When a school is selected for examination, the inspector will give a judgement on the standard based on the calculated educational results: if the school believes that the calculated educational results do not properly reflect the pupils' learning outcomes, the school can submit its own justification. This may result in a judgement of either satisfactory or not assessing educational outcomes. Annual risk analysisWe conduct an annual risk analysis for all schools and departments. Learning outcomes are one of the indicators we then look at. If this analysis reveals serious risks, we always conduct an investigation at school, preceded by an expert analysis (desk research) and a discussion with the board. This may result in us foregoing an investigation at school.For both PO and VO, we can additionally waive an investigation at school based on recent supervision history. ","Every year, the outcomes of the educational outcomes models for primary and secondary education are compared with previous years; based on this comparison, adjustments can be made to the models.

The estimate primarily serves to substantiate the education budget of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW).Besides underpinning the budget, the estimate is used to describe recent and expected developments in education. The annual report explaining the Reference Estimate and www.ocwincijfers.nl are the main products for this purpose.Finally, the Reference Estimate is also used as input for other estimates. For some of these estimates, data from this reference estimate up to 2070 is provided. The main users for follow-up estimates are:- OCW's study funding estimate;- institution forecasts from DUO;- labour market estimates from Project Education Labour Market by ROA;- education staff labour market estimates by Centerdata;- estimates for student housing by ABF Research;- the Mobility Assessment by KiM, the Dutch Knowledge Institute for Mobility Policy.","The Reference Estimate has proven accurate enough to underpin the budget of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Also, the Reference Estimate is not too complex: this allows a new estimate to be calculated in reasonable time. This is important because there is limited time to make the Reference Estimate. There are several months between receiving the latest data and delivering the estimate for budgeting purposes. However, an incorrect estimate can lead to a deficit or surplus in the budget for all of OCW.No personal data are used to prepare the Reference Estimate and no individual educational careers are included. Only total numbers of individuals in education streams are used. For example: total number of children who went from group 7 to group 8.Because individual educational careers are not included, valuable information might be missed in the current estimate. An alternative to the current model would be, for example, a microsimulation model, which does include information on individual pupils and students. However, this method is more complex than the current method. This requires more computer power, making the process slower. It also requires detailed data, where data quality is more difficult to guarantee. More complex behaviour can be part of a more detailed estimation model, which can improve the quality of the estimate. It just also takes more time in performing the estimation. Because of the time constraints for preparing a new estimate, these vulnerabilities are not desirable.","Preparing the budget of the Ministry of OCW is a public interest task. Without a budget, the Ministry of OCW would not be able to serve the public interest in all its ways. Article 105(1) of the Constitution describes that a State budget must be prepared. Section 2.5 of the Comptabiliteitswet 2016 describes that an estimate is a required part of the budget. Section 15 of the WRO describes that basic data from the education participants register may be used for budget preparation by the minister. The data in the education matrix are all taken from (the basic data from) the register of education participants and are used to prepare the estimate.The education matrix is created by DUO based on the education participant register (ROD). The original collection purpose of the data in the ROD is to provide data for a variety of purposes, which includes budget preparations (see WRO Article 5). The purpose purpose of processing the education matrix and reference estimate is budget preparation.",1.0,,referentieramingen@minocw.nl,nld,,"CBS's Population Forecast: this forecast contains the expected numbers of births, deaths, immigration and emigration.The education matrices from DUO's Information Products Department: the education matrices show the numbers of people per flow in, through and out of education. The education matrices are made on the basis of the enrolment data of educational institutions and provide insight into how students and pupils moved through education in a given year.CPB's unemployment forecast. This is used to estimate what proportion of MBO students take a convex course and what proportion take a blended course.","The reference estimate is carried out using an age-dependent flow model. This estimates flows of people into, through, out of and out of education to arrive at expected, future numbers of pupils and students.The starting point for the reference estimate is the education matrix. This lists the numbers of persons flowing into, through and out of education. From this, transition probabilities, the probability of someone moving from one level or grade of education to another, are derived. The numbers of individuals and probabilities are used to estimate future flows.For example: if 70 out of 100 vwo6 students moved on to wo last year, the transition probability is 70% to move from vwo6 to wo. Suppose the current number of vwo6 students is 130, then the model assumes that 70% of them (91 students) will go on to WO the following year.Basically, the most recent transition probability is used to estimate future numbers. Of some transition probabilities, the trend of recent years is considered. These are the probabilities of 'strategic transitions'. These are transitions between education types that are most affected by policy changes, such as from primary to secondary education and from secondary education to further education. The transition probabilities for these flows are determined with extrapolation based on the last 12 observations (years). However, these extrapolated transition probabilities are first evaluated. In case of good reason, the extrapolation of a particular transition probability is waived.The estimate grows with the population in the Netherlands. Using the CBS population forecast, the number of births is taken into account and corrected for mortality, immigration and emigration.For more information, see section 5.1 of the public report at https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/rapporten/2024/04/24/referentieraming-ocw-2024","One of the most valuable aspects of the algorithm is its steerability. This means that the estimate can be adjusted by an analyst based on additional information and take into account expected developments in education, such as effects of policies and the impact of unemployment on educational participation.For steering the reference estimate, advice is sought from education experts. Based on their advice, a decision is made on how and how much to steer.Making the reference estimate is an iterative process, with the results being analysed after each step. First, an estimate without controls is made. Then, one by one, controls are added. At each step, it is checked whether the controls generate unexpected or unrealistic outcomes.Once the iterative process is completed, the estimate is submitted to the so-called CLR (Pupil Estimates Coordination Group). The CLR includes policy directorates of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. They are the policy directorates of the various sectors (primary education, secondary education, etc.). They look critically at the forecast and advise the Knowledge Director of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to adopt the forecast.Only after the forecasts are set are they actually used for the ministry's budget.","When making the estimate, a 4-eye check is performed. This involves 2 analysts separately using the same agreed settings to make the estimate. They then check whether the results are the same. This 4-eye check is important to avoid errors during the estimation process.Before any changes are made to the methodology, advice is sought from the Pupil and Student Estimating Supervision Committee (BLS). This committee consists of experts from, among others, CBS, SCP, CPB and educational organisations. The tasks and composition of the BLS are laid down in a formal establishment decision, which can be found here: https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0047356/2022-10-25.The projections are coordinated with the Coordinating Group for Pupil Estimates (CLR).

Price announcement algorithm,Consumer and Market Authority,"This algorithm helps the ACM find price announcements in messages that might say something about tacit or explicit alignment. This information by itself does not trigger action, but it can be a reason for inspectors to further investigate a possible infringement.",Economy,,In use,"This algorithm is designed to counteract tacit or explicit alignment. Tacit coordination means that firms organise behaviour without agreement or contact by looking at each other and doing the same thing. Explicit coordination, on the contrary, involves clear and direct agreements together on, for example, price fixing. The algorithm can help find statements in messages used to regulate behaviour between companies. For example, a message in which an ice cream vendor complains about higher energy costs and indicates that he feels forced to pass them on from the start of the summer holidays. Mutual organising behaviour can be visible in messages about price announcements and can cause problems because it reduces competition. As a result, customers have to pay higher prices and have less choice. By detecting and addressing abuses in competition, companies compete more fairly, creating more choice for customers and better prices.If the algorithm gives information that there might be collusion, the ACM will investigate further. If the suspicions are correct, the ACM can take action. This could be by providing additional explanations, issuing a warning, issuing a binding instruction, imposing an order under penalty, or imposing a fine. With this algorithm, the ACM contributes to a healthy economy by making markets work well for all people and companies, now and in the future.","It is a lot of work to read one by one all messages that might contain price announcements.

The model then predicts a value between 0 and 1: a score of 1 means that the message is likely to contain a price announcement, while, for example, a score of 0.1 indicates that there is no price announcement in the message. Based on a (user-defined) cut-off value, messages are displayed for further investigation by inspectors.","The information provided by this algorithm is assessed by inspectors and further investigated if necessary.

To make data insightful, it uses a tagging algorithm. This algorithm analyses and categorises the collected information by tagging it based on predefined search terms. These search terms are selected by ACM inspectors as relevant for ACM supervision. The tagging algorithm searches the dataset and identifies each message that contains a relevant search term. This allows inspectors to quickly gain insight into the parts of the data of interest to them. After the data is tagged, the information is presented in a dashboard. On this dashboard, messages containing relevant tags are displayed by tag. Inspectors can further filter these tags based on date, source, or by entering specific search terms. This dashboard provides a clear and user-friendly view of the tagged data, giving inspectors easy access to the information that is relevant to them.It also uses a topic modelling algorithm to identify overarching topics within a collection of posts. Topic modelling is an algorithm used to identify abstract topics within a collection of documents. The process starts by converting tags into so-called ""sentence embeddings"", which is a series of numbers representing the meaning of the tags. It then looks at how best to group these sets of numbers, placing the messages that are closest to each other in terms of numbers into logical groups and clustering them into topics. The model knows how to self-discover topics within a collection of texts and can self-identify themes. This allows exploratory identification of topics and possible market issues. The algorithm uses a large language model to self-discover topics and determine trends based on the available information. For each forum, an algorithm assigns topics to pieces of text. The topic modelling process involves two main steps: using the underlying model and clustering the documents. The more data is available, the better the clusters can be formed and the more accurately topics can be identified.","The information provided by this algorithm is assessed by inspectors and further investigated if necessary. So there is always human intervention because someone checks the information.

Intelligent search in the BSN management facility,National Authority for Identity Data,The search algorithm used by the BSN management facility to search for individuals based on identifying data.,Organisation and business operations,Functionele specificaties Beheervoorziening BSN | RvIG,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to maximise the quality of the search process in the BSN Management Service. The BSN Management Service offers several services that require searching for the right person: UC12 Match identifying data (Known in the BRP as Presence query);UC23 Request BSN on the basis of identifying dataUC35 Request BSN for the purpose of cleaning and initial fillingUC37 Processing bulk demandFor all these services, it is important to find the right person if they are registered in the BSN Management Facility. The algorithm implements a form of 'intelligent' search, where, in addition to 1-to-1 searching with the entered data, a number of operations are performed on the entered data before searching. This increases that probability of finding the searched person if present in the database (reduces false negatives). At the same time, the algorithm ensures that the probability is so low that the wrong person is wound up (reduces false positives). ","If no intelligent search algorithm were deployed, the search of persons would take place on the basis of a 1-to-1 comparison of the search data entered with the personal data in the database. Experience shows, however, that the users of the Management facility are far from always having exactly the same data as are present in the database. For example, many organisations do not have the full first names of the person, but only the initials, or only the first name in full. It is also common that diacritical marks such as ã, â, ä or ligatures such as Ӕ are not registered or not registered correctly. Furthermore, there are many different spellings in circulation of (especially) foreign names. In a 1-to-1 comparison, these search queries would wrongly lead to the answer Not Found; we call this a false negative result. In this case, introducing some form of intelligent search increases the hit probability, and thus reduces the false-negative rate.At the same time, such a search algorithm may increase the probability of false positives, by finding individuals who do not meet the intended search query. When weighing up the advantages against the disadvantages, the choice was made to add measures that eliminate the unjustified use of a false-positive result as much as possible. This creates a balance between preventing false negatives without simultaneously making the percentage of false positives too large.","At the level of the law, this is the General Provisions Citizen Service Number Act.

This search method will be used for all specified fields.Diacritic transformation: The specified field, after diacrites transformation, exactly matches the found field (which has been stripped of its diacrites using the same method). The table below shows the fields for which diacrites transformation is applied. The note ""Diacrites"" already describes how to handle diacrites transformation.Other search methods: Different search methods for each field have been distinguished. These are listed in the second table. When selecting the search methods, the following assumptions were made:A well-identifiable person (preferably with identity document), identified at the counter, is assumed;Typing errors are not resolved by the proposed search methods.The diacritic transformation is performed as follows:All diacritics are removed and some special characters (e.g. Ǽ) are transformed to a corresponding character or characters in the range 'a' to 'z'. This is done according to a translation table (see conversion tables).All (normal) uppercase characters A to Z are converted to the corresponding lowercase characters.All remaining characters, other than digits '0' to '9' and letters 'a' to 'z', are converted to spaces after which all spaces are removed.Searching by first names:It is possible to search only by those first name(s) specified in the query. This means that if only one given name is specified, it is compared with the first given name in the given names field and if two given names are specified, they are compared with the first two given names in the given names field, etc. The order specified and the order recorded in the registration must be exactly the same.A search is performed by first initial only if only 1 position in the given names field is specified. The specified character is compared with the first position of the field in the registration (after diacritic transformation).Sex name search:Based on a conversion table, the given name is compared with the Sex name field in the registrations. Principles here are:Aimed at resolving differences in foreign gender names, as Dutch gender names are expected to be well documented (passport, driving licence);--The conversion is mainly focused on transliteration and transcription. This partially resolves differences in the conversion of non-Roman scripts. (In Russian passports, for example, Cyrillic is often transcribed according to a French transliteration. This differs from the Dutch or English transliteration);Particular attention has been paid to the conversion of Cyrillic (and derivative scripts), Chinese, Korean and Arabic;The proposed transliteration is applied to the gender name, as created after diacritic transformation (in a broad sense).The specified prefixes and gender name are stripped of diacritics and merged to compare with the fields prefixes and gender name from the registration, which have undergone similar processing.Weighting factorThe weighting factor of a field determines the order in which the ""dressing regime"" is applied: the determination of which additional search criteria are included to arrive at a search result. In addition, the weighting factor is used to calculate the score for the purpose of the Presence question. The weighting factors specified here represent the current setting of the intelligent search.

At that point, a (temporary) copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8. Minimum key figures for the accuracy of identifying personal data are as follows: Named entities (precision): 0.78, Named entities (recall): 0.76, Named entities (F-score): 0.77.

The clerk is required by the software to check all pages. The clerk determines whether the document is correctly anonymised.,"There is no risk of automated decision-making or infringement of fundamental rights, as the algorithm does not make binding decisions, but only suggests anonymising personal data. In addition, the algorithm is also used by the developer himself, which helps to quickly identify errors. Furthermore, the algorithm is regularly retrained to improve its performance. Our organisation has specifically requested that our documents not be used to train the algorithm. Should the algorithm be insufficiently accurate, we can refine the process by using so-called blacklists and whitelists. A blacklist contains terms or data, such as specific names or addresses, that should always be flagged and anonymised. In contrast, the whitelist contains information that does not need to be flagged, for example because it is not personal data or because it is information that should explicitly not be anonymised, such as job titles or general terms. This makes it possible to further improve the accuracy of anonymisation.The final step in the process is always a manual check by a county employee, who assesses whether the anonymisation has been carried out correctly. However, there is a risk that employees do not check properly. We try to mitigate this by educating employees on the importance of thorough checking and careful assessment of the data found by the algorithm.The remaining risk is the privacy risk when using Azure. Because of the Patriot Act, Microsoft may in some cases be required to transfer data to US authorities. To mitigate this risk, the vendor applies privacy by default. This means that the default settings are always privacy-friendly. When data is sent to the Azure service via the API, it can be synchronous or asynchronous. The vendor has chosen to disable the feature waabrij Azure temporarily stores the data sent via the API for debugging purposes. As a result, the data is deleted immediately after processing. Moreover, the vendor is ISO 27001 certified, confirming that data protection is well regulated. Using this software, with the mentioned precautions, offers more benefits than the risks of not properly anonymising data without this tool.",DataMask B.V.,Trustbound,"Anonymisation, Road lacquering, Lacquering software ",,2024-05,,"DEDA &amp; DPIA conducted by DataMask.

"Decline in value ""Who qualifies?"" ",Groningen Mining Damage Institute,Three algorithms used by the Mining Damage Institute Groningen (hereinafter IMG) to assess whether a property is eligible for compensation for depreciation. ,"Public finance, Living, Nature and Environment",www.schadedoormijnbouw.nl/regelingen/waardedaling,In use,"There are three algorithms used when assessing a valuation application. For the readability of this page, we refer to these algorithms as ''control algorithms''. The different control algorithms are explained below:Duplicate algorithm: this algorithm checks whether an application for depreciation has been submitted before. If an application has been submitted before, the application is automatically rejected.Postcode check algorithm: This algorithm checks whether the property's postcode falls within the depreciation area. This is the area in which properties may be located that have decreased in value due to gas extraction. If the property is not within the depreciation area, the application is automatically rejected.NAM algorithm: this algorithm checks whether compensation has been granted to a property by the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) in the past. If this is the case, a new application is rejected.The impact of all algorithms is that an application is rejected if it does not meet the algorithm's conditions. The automatic rejection of an application is thus based on facts.","The verification algorithms ensure that all applications for depreciation that should be considered can really be processed. The duplicate algorithm is necessary because the IMG has no authority under the law to consider a duplicate application. This is the case when a person has made a previous application for decrease in value at a particular property for the period he has been an owner, and it has been assessed.In addition, the postcode algorithm is designed to ensure that only people who are entitled to do so can apply. The valuation area has been carefully created. Based on the earthquake history in the earthquake area, the area has been determined. This means that for certain postcode areas, it has been determined that the properties within these postcode areas are eligible for depreciation compensation. The postcode algorithm is relevant because it checks whether the property falls within the depreciation area.The NAM algorithm is then relevant because it is clear from the law that the IMG may not process applications for which NAM has paid compensation in the past. This also applies to depreciation applications.","Duplicate check and postcode check: Article 2(3)(a) under 2 Temporary Groningen Act: IMG's task and authority is to deal with damage and, to that end, to determine entitlement to compensation for damage.NAM control: Article 2 paragraph 4 sub b Temporary Groningen Act: The IMG is not authorised to deal with a claim for compensation if it concerns damage for which a settlement agreement has been concluded by the operator with the victim or the victim's representative.",1.0,,fg@schadedoormijnbouw.nl en privacy@schadedoormijnbouw.nl,nld,,Postcode check: postcode of the property for which the application is submitted.Duplicate check: postcode and house number of the property for which the application is submitted.NAM check: name and date of sale of the applicant.,"Postcode algorithm: in the algorithm, the postcode list for the value reduction area is known. When a postcode is given as input, the algorithm indicates whether the postcode is on the postcode list for the value reduction area or not. If the postcode is not on the postcode list, the application is rejected. Duplicate algorithm: the algorithm is trained with all applications for compensation due to decrease in value. When an application is given as input, the algorithm indicates whether the Institute has dealt with this application before or not. If the application has been dealt with before, the application is rejected.NAM algorithm: the algorithm is trained with all compensations ever paid out by NAM. When an application is given as input, the algorithm indicates whether the property from this application is on NAM's compensation list or not. If the application appears on the compensation list, the application is rejected.","The control algorithms are not controlled by a human. The algorithms are based on facts. Inputting them will always lead to the same outcome (""postcode is or is not in the depreciation area""). Control by a human is therefore not necessary for the deployment of these algorithms.

In addition, the location of a property and the quakes that have occurred in this area over the years are considered. Based on all this data, the algorithm calculates the decrease in value of a property. ","Advantages: the calculation method ensures that every applicant gets compensation to which they are entitled.

Disadvantages: this will be updated later.","Article 2 paragraph 3 sub a under 3 Temporary Groningen Act: IMG's task and authority is to deal with damage and, to this end, to determine the amount of compensation for damage or, if the applicant so wishes and the damage lends itself to it, the measures to be taken in kind.",1.0,,fg@schadedoormijnbouw.nl en privacy@schadedoormijnbouw.nl,nld,,Necessary data for an application:PostcodeData used in developing the calculation method: Earthquake history (location and severity) Postcodes value areaEnvironmental characteristics of all Dutch postcodesEarthquake damage data per dwelling and postcode areaWOZ-values objects value decline area,"All postcodes within the valuation area have been classified into severity categories. The severity category is determined by the quake history within a postcode area. For the calculation of the decrease in value, the WOZ value of the property serves as a starting point.

For a number of digital applications, a municipality can choose whether iBurgerzaken, may process them automatically without the intervention of a civil affairs employee. iBurgerzaken processes an application fully automatically if no check results in a warning.

Game-based assessment (GBA) in selection of government-wide traineeships,Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations,A GBA is one part of the selection process. Candidates play several games to give an impression of the fit with the trainee profile. The test scores are visible in the candidate file as a report.,Work,https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/starters/traineeships/het-rijkstraineeprogramma https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/starters/traineeships/rijks-hbo-traineeprogramma https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/starters/traineeships/traineeship-rijksinkoopprofessionals https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/starters/traineeships/rijks-i-traineeship https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/starters/traineeships/internationaal-beleidsmedewerker-buitenlandse-zaken,In use,"The main purpose of deploying the GBA is to use the test results in conjunction with the results of other selection items to make an objective selection decision and ensure more equality in the mode of selection: no game experience is required for the GBA. Sub-goals of the deployment of this algorithm are:


A match based on qualities and talents rather than education level.
A structured approach that is the same for all candidates.
Making the test more accessible to candidates and appropriate for the target group.
Provide a way (in combination with other selection components) to select from many applications, which is not possible manually.

","
These are the following public values that inform the use of the algorithm:
Public values to which the algorithm contributes:

Equality (equal opportunities): This is where implementation research was done prior to the deployment of the GBA. The GBA targets a wide range of competences and talents which promotes diversity in the selection decision. 
Efficiency: There are very high numbers of applications for the State Trainee Programme. The government does not have the resources and capacity to handle this manually and is therefore forced to opt for a different selection mechanism that allows for more efficient use of limited government resources.
Effectiveness: An effective government needs staff that is a good match for the tasks at hand. The GBA takes a broader look at competences and talents than previous tools (which mainly focused on intelligence). This allows a more sophisticated search for suitable candidates.


The public values that may be compromised by the use of the algorithm, or at least should be seen as a concern, are:

Equality: It is essential that the algorithm does not contain a bias that puts certain groups at a disadvantage.
Explainability: It is important that the GBA is and remains explainable and that there is a clear procedure for candidates to request more information on how a result was established. This procedure should also be actively communicated.
Accessibility: Accessibility as a public value may be at stake: not everyone can make the GBA. Sufficient customisation should be possible. Candidates are given the opportunity to share circumstances that may affect the selection procedure with Leeuwendaal and/or the State. All comments are gone through and assessed on an individual basis. Sometimes exemptions are granted on that basis.

The values outlined here should be seen as points of consideration, including for possible design changes and future developments. It is important to note that the negative impact on values formulated here will be mitigated by taking measures.

","
The Civil Service Act 2017 includes that ""Public employers may conduct an investigation into the suitability and competence of an employee for a civil service position"".  The following applies to the GBA:
The legal basis lies in the fact that a company has the right to hire a new employee: a government employer has the right to conduct an investigation into the suitability and competence of an employee. However, there is nothing to say about the procedure. However, there is an application code for this. This application code tells us more about the use of digital assessments: 
""If the organisation uses data recruitment in pre-selection, such as digital assessment, Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) or algorithms, for example, these should be validated and transparent. With the organisation using A.I and algorithms, the potential risks and shortcomings thereof should be clear. At all times, care and confidentiality should be ensured and no health-related questions should be asked. The applicant will receive a reasoned result after participation, if requested by the applicant"".
The use of the DPIA and the IAMA ensures that the assessment is validated and transparent.
",1.0,,rijkstrainee@rijksoverheid.nl,nld,,"
Only data that can be extracted from the GBA completed by the candidate is used. The algorithm only uses data necessary to determine the final score (data minimisation). For example, no demographic information is made available to the models.
The exception here is when a candidate indicates having a neurodiverse condition. In that case, adjustments are made to allow the candidate to still take the test if the candidate is able to do so. Employer can also choose to exempt candidates from the GBA.
","This is a rule-based algorithm. Thus, there is no self-learning algorithm. It uses only the data obtained during the test. The answers entered by the candidates and chosen method during the test determine the scores on the competences. These competences are aligned with the State and determine the fit with the trainee profile. The test is started from the candidate's file through a technical link. No personal data are shared in this link. When the candidate is ready, the scores are calculated and retrieved from the GBA and the competency scores are displayed in the candidate's file.","
Based on the scores coming from the GBA, a report is fed back to the applicant. These scores are part of the file, which along with other data such as CV and motivation questions are used in the selection process. No selection decisions are made without the intervention of a State employee.
So there is definitely ""human in the loop"" because the recommendation is made by a person and the score is only part of this decision.
","
The effectiveness of the GBA is reviewed annually to ensure that the algorithm is and remains effective. 
To prevent the GBA algorithm from being used for other purposes for which it is not intended, it has been agreed that a separate IAMA will be carried out for each use. 
Because the deployment of an algorithm can raise questions, the provision of information to those involved is reviewed annually, partly on the basis of the questions asked during the application periods of State trainees.

Public space reports,Municipality of Leeuwarden,"If something needs to be repaired or cleaned up on the street or in a park, it can be reported to the municipality via Signalen, the open source notification system for and by municipalities.",Public Order and Safety,https://www.leeuwarden.nl/melden-bij-de-gemeente/melding-woon-werk-en-leefomgeving/,In use,"If something needs to be repaired or cleaned up on the street or in a park, it can be reported to the municipality through Signalen, the open source reporting system of, for and by municipalities. A dangerous traffic situation, housing nuisance or nuisance from people and the hospitality industry can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report best fitted into (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality. But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, it was sometimes difficult to find the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. Based on this, it determines which category the report best fits and which department should handle it. So the caller no longer has to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right department. ",,,1.0,,privacy@leeuwarden.nl,nld,,"Notifications The dataset consists of notifications made previously. Initially, we used past notifications to train the algorithm. It is regularly retrained with new reports and implemented corrections to existing reports. If the S&amp;I team or departments see an incorrect categorisation, (see Human monitoring) they correct it manually in the notification system. These corrections are used in retraining. The Signals application is still under development. It is being investigated whether retraining the algorithm can be automated in the future. We cannot disclose this dataset in this register. Because the data comes from a free text field, it may contain personal data, although this is explicitly not requested. E-mail address and phone number for follow-up questions Someone making a report can leave a telephone number and/or e-mail address. We then keep the reporter informed of the progress and we have the option of calling this person back. This information is not kept longer than necessary for this purpose and is therefore not used by the algorithm. Contact details are anonymised after one year and reports that have been dealt with are deleted in their entirety after five years. For other information on processing personal data, see: https://www.leeuwarden.nl/privacy-en-avg/privacy/ ","Architecture of the model The text of the notification is divided into individual words. Each word in a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight. From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to fit. ","All reports categorised as ""other"" with less than 40% certainty go to the Service &amp; Information (S&amp;I) department. There, one of the employees assesses the report and the report is still categorised. Reports that are wrongly forwarded to the wrong category are also manually placed in the correct category by the responsible department (sometimes via the S&amp;I team).","There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. Staff from the S&amp;I team review those notifications and manually put them in the right category. So if the algorithm is not working properly, it takes a little longer for the report to reach the right department. The reporter can add personal data if he or she wants to be kept informed. This data is stored securely and not used by the algorithm. ",This is a common ground project at the municipality of Amsterdam. The final version can be managed by municipalities themselves.

The municipality of Amsterdam is engaged in a programme to improve contact with Amsterdammers. In doing so, the Amsterdam municipality believes that interaction with the Amsterdammer should be personal, simple and accessible. One of the ways the municipality of Amsterdam does this is by bringing together the information in all our 'channels' (such as phone, mail, website, social media, counter) so that (regardless of how you contact us) you always get the same information. Using the voicebot also contributes to these goals. This ensures that staff have more time for personal contact with citizens, where needed.

Initially, the PolyAI development team creates a list of phrases to trigger a specific intention. For example, ""I want to apply for a passport"" or ""I need a new passport"". The voicebot can generalise beyond these examples, so a caller does not have to use these phrases word for word to trigger the intention.

If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal.

De applicatie 4Woz is een standaard WOZ-taxatiesysteem van het bedrijf 4Value, dat ook door andere gemeenten in Nederland wordt gebruikt.",In use,"The 4Woz application supports in the valuation process for the implementation of the WOZ Act. 4Woz supports the management of property characteristics, the analysis of market data, the determination of appraisal values, the checking and approval of the appraisal values into (in IBS) WOZ values to be disposed of and the preparation of the appraisal report as substantiation of the WOZ value. The algorithms play a role particularly in determining the appraisal values and preparing the appraisal report because they involve complex calculations and comparisons. The appraisal algorithm functions well when the value level is correct, the inter-value ratios are right and there is a reconciliation of the appraised values to the analysed market data. The appraisal report algorithm works well when appraisal reports make the appraised value plausible, e.g. by presenting all the property characteristics of the property itself, mentioning its own market data and (in the case of houses) referring to three comparable sold houses with a WOZ value.The effect on the daily life of citizens and businesses is that the application 4Woz enables the municipality of The Hague to annually make a new, up-to-date WOZ valuation for all WOZ objects in The Hague and to substantiate it with a valuation report. The WOZ assessments are sent annually to citizens and companies (on paper or digitally) together with a WOZ decision open to objection and appeal. This is communicated through local media, the website of the municipality of The Hague and MijnDenHaag.nl. The WOZ value of a house is public to a limited extent and can be consulted via wozwaardeloket.nl. Citizens and companies can request the assessment report of the WOZ objects of which they are interested parties (owner and/or user). Users of the WOZ value, such as the National Tax Office and the Water Board, use the WOZ value for taxation, among other things.","There is no better alternative to 4Woz's algorithms. On the contrary, 4Woz itself is currently seen as an alternative to a traditional way of valuing where individual valuations can be made outside the IBS valuation model. In a completely traditional way of working, individual, municipal valuers each make their own interpretation of property characteristics and market data into an appraisal value. A computerised valuation model that works according to algorithms generally helps to make the analysis of market data, valuation of properties and substantiation through a valuation report much more consistent and unambiguous. The frequency of annual valuations and WOZ decisions is only possible thanks to algorithms such as those included in 4Woz.","The legal basis that makes working with algorithms/taxation models such as 4Woz necessary is the WOZ (Valuation of Immovable Property Act). Under this, the municipality of The Hague annually determines the value of all WOZ properties via a WOZ decision open to objection and appeal. The assessed value is substantiated with a valuation report that is available to interested parties. The municipality also implements the WOZ Act for its customers, including the National Tax Office and the Water Board. Data are supplied to customers via the National Provision WOZ (LV WOZ).",1.0,,datashop@denhaag.nl,nld,,"The WOZ Act makes extensive use of basic registrations. The WOZ object is delimited on the basis of data on property recorded in the Basic Land Registry Register, BRK. And usage is based on natural and non-natural persons listed in the Basisregistratie Personen (BRP) and/or the Handelsregister (NHR). When delineating WOZ objects, the relationship is also made to premises and addressable objects from the Basic Register of Addresses and Buildings (BAG). Part of the tax application IBS also forms the Property Valuation Key Register (WOZ), which records the object, the interest (the tax liability) and the WOZ value. The WOZ sector model provides insight into the hundreds of data included in a tax application and valuation system such as 4Woz. It takes too far to write this out here. Two main groups of data are processed through the algorithm, First, these are object characteristics such as primary object characteristics (type of object, size, year of construction, outbuildings and the like), secondary object characteristics which are a qualification of e.g. location, maintenance, quality and appearance. The second group of data includes market data such as asking prices, purchase prices, rents, construction costs and land prices. These are mostly reduced to key figures. The algorithm then calculates the values of WOZ properties in components using object characteristics x key figures. The sum of the value of components is the assessed value, which is approved and delivered to IBS (Integrated Tax System) after verification.","In fact, algorithms are very simple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division when calculating appraisal values from object characteristics and unit prices. The same is true when preparing valuation reports. More complicated sub-processes such as coding and measuring object characteristics and classifying objects into groups and the like is still old-fashioned manual work. This also applies to setting the unit prices used for calculation. The fact that algorithms are nevertheless applied in the form of 4Woz has to do with the fact that almost 300,000 WOZ objects with a multitude of WOZ sub-objects and object characteristics) are valued in an annual process. In doing so, the algorithm helps to do this in a consistent manner to ensure as much as possible that equal objects are treated equally.One group of algorithms includes the calculation rules in which, based on object characteristics and unit prices set by the appraiser, the appraisal value is calculated in parts. A two algorithm is used to prepare residential property valuation reports based on a kind of penalty point system. Here, a legal requirement is that this appraisal report shows three properties with WOZ value and an analysed market data (purchase price, exceptionally a sample appraisal).","Yes, certainly there is human intervention in the sense of the user of the application 4Woz. WOZ data managers take care of managing property characteristics in a consistent manner, WOZ valuers analyse market data in interaction with stakeholders (citizens and businesses). WOZ appraisers set up the models, which amounts to determining unit prices and setting the influence of object characteristics on the appraisal value. Finally, the outcome of the appraisal model is checked by WOZ appraisers before the WOZ values are determined. The 4Woz application is used in an annual process. In it, managing property characteristics and performing market analysis are continuous activities. After WOZ decisions are made in IBS within eight weeks after 1 January each year, 4Woz supports successively in a number of WOZ sub-processes. At first mainly in the handling of objections and appeals, in summer and autumn the emphasis is on the set-up of valuation models, in autumn the emphasis is on preliminary consultations with specific stakeholders and on large-scale checking of the quality of valuations. Within eight weeks of 1 January, the annual cycle is in principle completed with the re-adoption of the WOZ assessments. This is basically the way to freeze and formalise the outcomes of the algorithms. Until then, a WOZ assessor can continuously improve the WOZ assessment before it is determined as a WOZ value. The handling of objections is a formal moment to reconsider the outcome of the valuation model with the citizen or company.","For automated valuation models, risks include, in particular, a poor quality of object characteristics, insufficient or inadequately analysed market data, the set-up of the valuation models with key figures and a poor verification process of appraised values. The outcomes of 4Woz's algorithms depend on the quality of property characteristics, proper analysis of market data and the proper design of the assumptions of the valuation models. Great importance is attached at the front end of this valuation process to the professionalism of the WOZ data managers for an unambiguous and complete registration of object characteristics. Similarly, importance is attached to craftsmanship of the WOZ valuer for proper market analysis, knowledge of the market, design and operation of the valuation models and verification of valuations. Through informal contact, many citizens and businesses are also able to provide information for the benefit of the valuation process and/or objection handling.Objections can be raised against the outcome of the process in which the 4Woz algorithm is used. The outcome of the algorithm is the WOZ value determined by a WOZ decision open to objection and appeal. Another outcome of the algorithm is an assessment report substantiating the WOZ value. According to the WOZ Act, the interested party (owner/user) of a WOZ assessment can submit a reasoned objection within six weeks of the date of the decision, pointing out incorrect data. As part of the handling of the objection, the grievances are assessed and the data underlying the WOZ assessment including the WOZ value are corrected if necessary. The ruling on the objection is open to appeal. The interested party can also always address a question to the Tax Department of the municipality of The Hague. This can sometimes lead to ex officio adjustments.",,,WOZ,,,,,Impactful algorithms,,,,41525861

The results of the algorithm are not intended as grounds for immediate decisions or actions without verification of the results.By better understanding the cause of noise pollution experienced by citizens, the municipality can better perform its task in maintaining a pleasant comfortable outdoor space. Besides being able to identify the type of noise (noise recognition), the noise level (decibels) was also measured in a test setup. At present, no citizens are interacting with the algorithm. Two residents of the area where this algorithm was tested were involved for the duration of the test to investigate whether the intended concept application works. They gained insight into the decibel levels measured in the outdoor area through a dashboard (nb: the algorithm itself does not measure decibels). At these two residents' homes, a sensor was hung on their facade to verify what the noise levels are at their homes. Besides these two intensively involved residents, a larger event was organised during the summer of 2020 to inform visitors and residents of and on the promenade, during the Smart @Sea festival.

The spectrograms are images of 128x128 pixels with greyscale values. These spectrograms are then classified by an image recognition algorithm into a number of categories, such as ""stationary traffic"", ""music"", ""honking"", etc. This image recognition model is a relatively small convolutional neural network of five layers.

The model runs in python, using the Tensorflow library.",The algorithm can be stopped by shutting down the processes on the sensor. This can be done remotely by Cyrb or by the administrator by switching off the power to the sensor. No processes flow directly from the algorithm's outcomes.,"The algorithm is trained on public datasets of similar sounds. Because these do not always sound the same and have the same characteristics (and nature) as the sounds captured on location, the algorithm could make errors in sound recognition. Because the algorithm only serves imaging purposes, it does not pose any direct risks to the citizens and entrepreneurs involved. The risk of data leakage (recorded sounds) has been overcome by not storing the sound on the device but directly executing the sound recognition on the device.As long as the system is not used, there is also no need to update the 2019 DPIA.",,,,,,,,Impactful algorithms,,1: Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA),,32429839

The status of PDF2GIS is 'under development'. PDF2GIS is in the test phase of phase 1 flat drawing (of 3 phases).",Organisation and business operations,De code wordt niet openbaar gepubliceerd. De applicatie PDF2GIS wordt in opdracht van de gemeente Den Haag ontwikkeld door Coders Co. De businesscase en het intellectueel eigendom liggen bij de leverancier. PDF2GIS is geïnitieerd vanuit project Startup in Residence.,In development,"The PDF2GIS application is designed to retrieve building data from subdivision drawings (phase 1), construction drawings (phase 2) and estate agent floor plans (phase 3). It involves the coherent retrieval of objects, relationships and attributes of objects such as property, residence object, building zone, level, space and the flat right, among others. Coherent acquisition benefits quality (including completeness, consistency and accuracy). Higher quality reduces queries and coordination problems between e.g. (basic) registrations. The application eventually replaces measuring in a paper drawing or in a digital drawing with e.g. Bluebeam (where existing lines are redrawn).  A data manager or geo-information manager operates the application and can intervene in each of 13 steps to make corrections. The data are used in (basic) registrations such as WOZ, BAG and in the future perhaps SOR (Cohesive Object Registration). The programme functions well when the quality of the data can measure up to manually collected data.","There is no alternative to PDF2GIS's algorithms. In fact, PDF2GIS itself is seen as an alternative to a traditional way of collecting building data. In a traditional way of working, individual municipal employees each make their own interpretation of lines and text in order to deduce building data. This involves proportionally fewer consistent interpretations and proportionally more errors, e.g. in calibration. The strength of PDF2GIS is the ability to collect data that are currently still kept separately in different basic registries in a coherent way. Current practice is that data in four different registries (WOZ, BAG, BGT, 3D city model) are not maintained simultaneously and from different sources. This is comparatively expensive (differences in feedback etc.) and the quality is comparatively low (due to differences in time, accuracy, precision etc.). There are no other programmes with algorithms that can collect building data in coherence, using existing, known building data, such as in the system of basic registries or the WOZ registration.","Under the BAG Act (on managing addresses and buildings data), among other things, the size of the residential object is measured, under the WOZ Act (on the valuation of immovable property) the size of building areas on building floors within the WOZ object. WOZ uses BAG and in The Hague, WOZ is also delegated source holder for area data in BAG (WOZ measures for BAG in order to use the same area data for every building municipality-wide).",1.0,,datashop@denhaag.nl,nld,,"Data in basic registries are used in the PDF2GIS algorithm.

The result of PDF2GIS is ideally processed to (basic) registrations WOZ and BAG, in the future to the SOR (coherent object registration). The algorithm processes a drawing (flat drawing phase 1, construction drawing in phase 2 and estate agent's floor plan in phase 3) together with known data from basic registrations. As far as possible, the processing results in data about buildings. These are the objects, relations and attributes as mentioned in information models of BAG (IMBAG), WOZ (IMWOZ) and the SOR.","PDF2GIS uses algorithms such as text detection (EAST algorithm), text recognition (Tesseract OCR), line recognition (Hough Line Transform), polygon-shaping algorithms as well as algorithms for georeferencing (rubber-sheeting etc.), among others.","Yes, certainly there is human intervention in the sense of user of the algorithm PDF2GIS. Distilling building data from scanned (sometimes old, less legible) drawings is (still) too complex to be left 'blind' solely to an algorithm. Processing a drawing is done in 13 steps in phase 1. And in each step, the user is expected to make corrections if necessary. For the time being, the user also has to process the result himself in possibly decreasing (basic) registrations.","There are no risks associated with working with PDF2GIS's algorithms. The biggest pitfall is working with a drawing that does not represent an actual situation. Employees working with PDF2GIS pay attention to this by studying visual material such as aerial photos. Moreover, the output of PDF2GIS eventually forms the input of a chain in which building data is validated and distributed. There is no question of bias, in the sense that the algorithm may produce a systematic difference in representativeness ('discriminates'). At most, algorithms may work better on drawings of common buildings (flats) and less well on unique buildings, requiring the user to make manual corrections more often.",,,,,,,,Other algorithms,,,,56889459

The insights from the prediction model can only be used through human intervention and with the context knowledge and experience of employees involved. ,"The risks of the algorithm were identified in advance and during the construction of the prediction model. Because the prediction model does not make statements about individuals but about the use of facilities in neighbourhoods, there was no risk that the results from the model could violate the privacy of specific individuals. Furthermore, we only worked with neighbourhoods that were sufficiently large (more than 100 inhabitants) and where enough people used the Wmo (more than 100 users). One reason for this is that it does not allow for disclosure. That is, by combining characteristics, we cannot identify who the potential users of Wmo facilities are. Furthermore, when building the model, we weighed up together with the privacy officer which variables could and could not be included from a privacy perspective. Here, the AVG was always the starting point. In addition, explainability of the model and the results is a relevant and decisive criterion. Finally, Utrecht University's The Ethical Data Assistant was used to identify possible ethical problems in advance. This led to the drafting of an ethical framework. The question of what role bias plays in the use of the algorithm is far too general a question, as there are many forms of bias.

Image recognition Image matching: Previously handled damages,Mining Damage Institute Groningen,Automated recognition of previously assessed damages to prevent previously processed damages from being processed again.,"Law, Nature and Environment",https://www.schadedoormijnbouw.nl/,In use,"A loss adjuster must perform a manual check to determine whether a loss has been treated previously. An expert does this by comparing photos from a loss report with photos from old reports. Assessing whether a loss has been treated previously is a time-consuming and error-prone process. The Groningen Mining Damage Institute (hereinafter: IMG) has therefore developed an algorithm to support the expert in this process. Purpose: The algorithm supports a loss adjuster in determining whether a loss has previously been assessed by the IMG or its predecessors, such as the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij or the Centrum Veilig Wonen. According to article 2 paragraph 4 of the Temporary Groningen Act, the Institute is not legally authorised to assess a loss if it has previously been dealt with. Impact: The algorithm tells an expert whether the newly recorded damage matches damage already known to the Institute. The algorithm does not combine personal characteristics, aspects and/or circumstances of you as a person to arrive at an assessment. Only damage that is on the photos is compared with each other.",Assessing whether a claim has been previously treated is a time-consuming and error-prone process.

Re-examining benefit recipients,Municipality of Rotterdam,Residents who do not have sufficient income or assets themselves usually receive benefits. The municipality of Rotterdam investigates whether the benefits that residents receive are legitimate and still correspond to their current situation. The algorithm that supported the selection for these re-examinations has not been used since the beginning of 2022. ,Social Security,https://algoritmeregister.rotterdam.nl/p/Onzealgoritmes/53761720551735604,Out of use,"The model made a prediction for the chance of unlawfulness or legality, by looking at the data known in the administration of citizens whose legality had been investigated in previous years. The conclusion may have been that the benefit was paid out lawfully; or that the previously paid out benefit did not match the actual situation (unlawfulness). Based on this historical data, a prediction can be made about the chance of legality or illegality for current benefit recipients. This prediction is therefore made on the basis of the data known in our administration of current benefit recipients. The outcome of the model is a 'risk assessment number' that varies between 0 (high chance of legality) and 1 (high chance of illegality). The benefit recipients with the highest risk assessment number are invited for an investigation interview, unless, for example, an investigation into legality has already taken place recently. The number of benefit recipients invited is determined annually on the basis of the risk assessment model. The model has been developed anew every year, because new research data becomes available every year. The information from recent studies into legality has therefore always been included in the development of a new model. The municipality of Rotterdam has not used this algorithm since the beginning of 2022. Our exploration into an improved 'risk model' has shown that it is currently not possible to develop an algorithm that fits within our policy.","The model has not made a statement about legality or illegality: the research required for that statement has always been carried out by an employee.

The algorithm does not process information that can directly lead to discrimination, such as nationality, age or health status. The municipality has investigated whether information is used in the model that can be related to nationality or origin, such as language skills, in order to prevent the chance of discrimination or bias.

The exploration of an improved 'risk model' has shown that it is currently not possible to to develop an algorithm that fits within our policy. When the algorithm was still in use, the following description applied: The Department of Work & Income (W&I) regularly checks whether residents are entitled to benefits and whether these still match their situation. Benefit recipients can therefore be invited for an interview. To determine who receives an invitation, the municipality uses various selection methods, including a risk algorithm. This algorithm helps the municipality to estimate which benefit recipients are most likely to receive benefits that no longer match their situation. This has two advantages for society: 1) This helps the municipality to prevent overpayment. 2) In addition, benefit recipients who are less likely to have special circumstances are less likely to be invited for an interview. The risk assessment algorithm works predictively. This algorithm uses data that the W&I department needs to perform its tasks and to be able to pay out the benefit. This involves data such as the amount of the benefit and the family situation. But also the skills and qualities of the job seeker, which give you more chances on the labour market. This comes from two data sources: 1) Socrates: the benefits administration system. This determines and records the amount of benefits provided. This system contains data on, for example, the living situation of the benefit recipient. 2. RWM/Raak: system in which data on the reintegration of job seekers is recorded. The municipality only uses data from its own administration. There is no link with other data files. The risk assessment algorithm is only used to invite benefit recipients for an interview. The algorithm does not make a statement about whether the benefit is justified. An employee of the department assesses whether there is a right to a benefit. This depends on your data and this is different for everyone.","The risk assessment model does not determine whether someone is receiving benefits lawfully or unlawfully. The model does form part of the determination of which benefit recipients are invited for an investigation interview. An expert income consultant from the Work & Income department of the municipality of Rotterdam carries out this investigation. After carrying out the investigation, the income consultant determines whether the job seeker's benefits have been provided lawfully or unlawfully and whether they still fit the situation in which the benefit recipient finds himself.","To determine the risk of an algorithm, the municipality of Rotterdam uses a fixed classification model. The risk assessment model has been designated as a high-risk algorithm. The municipality is therefore taking additional safety measures. These include measures that ensure that the development and use of the model is properly supervised. For example, specific attention is paid to the ethical risks and an external supervisory committee monitors the design and use of the model. This committee is expected to be in place at the beginning of 2022. If an algorithm is in the high-risk category, a human test is part of the work process in which the algorithm in question is used. The chance of bias is limited because the risk assessment model is only used to determine who receives an invitation for an investigation interview. The algorithm does not determine whether someone is lawfully or unlawfully receiving benefits. This is done by income consultants from the W&I department. They conduct extensive research into the situation, together with the benefit recipient. After all, providing benefits is tailor-made and is done at an individual level.",,,,,01-2017,02-2022,,High-Risk AI-system,,,,36585638

Contains no drawbacks and therefore a justifiable bet.,"The process is initiated using the 2012 Procurement Act. This mandates that the selection of market participants in private procurement procedures is carried out objectively. Also, this process falls under the General Principles of Good Governance. This is a general set of written and unwritten ground rules that the government is expected to adhere to, such as the fair-play principle and the principle of equality.",1.0,https://tenderned.nl/aankondigingen/overzicht/207086/publicatie,info@flevoland.nl,nld,,"The selection system uses several pieces of data. First, these are the information/contact data of the companies and contacts that constitute the potential contractors. These are data including name, address, telephone number, Chamber of Commerce number, e-mail address, etc. To be included in the shortlist, the companies should meet the following suitability requirements with associated documents/data: Validly signed Uniform European Tender Document (UEA), Commercial Register extract, Tax and Customs Administration Declaration of Payment History, Completed and signed Procurement Conduct Declaration (GVA), possession of CO2 performance ladder step 3 certificate, 1 reference over the past 3 years per competency in accordance with one or more shortlists, ISO 9001 Certificate, possession of a VCA* certification version 2008/5.1, the company must possess a Procurement Conduct Declaration (GVA) issued by Justis relating to the mandatory grounds for exclusion. These requirements are manually checked for compliance, and serve as entry to the shortlist/ selection process. For the ranking of the rough lists, Better Performance (formerly Past Performance) is used, which is linked to the national uniform method and database of performance measurement by CROW Better Performance. This involves the performance questionnaires and national enterprise score database.","The algorithm is a selection system for selecting contractors to be invited for the multiple-negotiated procurement of infrastructure works. The selection system works on the basis of rough lists. A shortlist includes all companies that have applied for the list and meet suitability requirements such as holding a required certificate. A company wants to be asked for works it is good at; Flevoland Province would like to invite companies suitable for the work.In order to select the right companies, it is important to know the content of the contract. For each work, Flevoland Province determines which wholesale list or (in the case of an integral contract) which combination of wholesale lists, the contract falls within. The contract value is then estimated. On the basis of these rough lists, suitability requirements and contract value, contractors can show interest and thus qualify for an invitation to tender. From these interested potential contractors, a selection should be made which will actually receive an invitation. To do this in a fair way, a selection system is used that is supported by data from Better Performance.Better Performance (formerly Past Performance) Better Performance measures and evaluates the performance during the execution of contracts using CROW, the national uniform method of performance measurement. This performance measurement is carried out using questionnaires that result in a final mark. The higher the final mark, the higher the mark on the ranking of the wholesale list. The ranking per groslist is divided into 'top companies' and 'other companies'. For each wholesale list, Flevoland Province determines how many companies can have a top ranking, which depends on the number of companies on the wholesale list. The maximum number of companies with a top position is about 25% of the total number of companies on the wholesale list. The minimum score for joining the top list is the figure 8. Beginning companies that do not yet have a score, due to not having performed any work yet, are automatically assigned a 7. Depending on the amount of companies to be selected, part of the selection is chosen from the top companies and part from the other companies. This way, novice contractors also get a chance to be invited. After the selection system provides a selection, the process is further taken up manually, such as sending the invitations.","Human intervention is used within the process. The wholesale list provides a selection, but actual invitations are sent by human intervention. There is also the option to manually choose up to a maximum of two companies for selection.","The software resides with an external party, this means there is a data transfer with all the risks involved.",The external supplier of the algorithm is Qfact.,,,,2020-09,,,Impactful algorithms,"1: Aanbestedingswet 2012, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0032203/2022-03-02. 2: Aanbestedingswet 2012, https://infomil.nl/vaste-onderdelen/onderwerpen",,,73382599
Zivver,Municipality of Bergen op Zoom,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging.This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,https://bergenopzoom.nl/contact-en-openingstijden,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor. If it turns out that the algorithm is making incorrect classifications more often, this is picked up by the monitoring so that adjustments to the algorithm can be made.

But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, people did not always choose the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing reports.

As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight.

The fingerprints in question are those recorded in the travel document.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,We deploy the algorithm as technical support for verifying whether two fingerprints come from the same finger of the same person. The fingerprints in question are those recorded in the travel document.,"Fingerprints are only used to check a person's identity (identity verification) if there is doubt about the authenticity of the travel document and the holder's identity. Before taking fingerprints, we first check the authenticity of the travel document and the identity of the holder with a facial image. 
There is more on fingerprinting in this situation in recital 19 of Regulation 2019/1157. Using fingerprints for identity verification together with facial comparison is an appropriate way to establish a person's identity. It reduces the susceptibility to fraud, allowing us to better secure travel documents. ","The legal basis for both the first and second cases lie in Regulation (EC) 2252/2004* and Regulation (EU) 2019/1157** . These regulations provide, among other things, that the fingerprints to be included in passports, travel documents and identity cards can only be used to verify: a) the authenticity of the document and b) the identity of the holder. The provisions are anchored in national legislation, namely in Section 3 of the Passport Act in conjunction with the regulations below: 1. With regard to the first case in which the algorithm is used (quality comparison), Article 28a of the Passport Implementation Regulations Netherlands 2001 describes the manner in which the fingerprints of the applicant for a travel document are recorded and in which cases this may be waived. The quality of the recorded fingerprint(s) is crucial therein (paragraph 2-3)*** 2. That the algorithm can be deployed for identity verification upon issue is articulated in Article 4.6 of the Passport Decree. With the deployment of the algorithm, biometric data and thus special personal data are processed within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG).  In principle, the AVG prohibits the processing of special personal data. However, the national legislator has used the space for member states to create exemptions for processing special personal data for reasons of public interest (Article 9(2) AVG). Article 29 of the AVG Implementation Act allows processing of biometric data for the purpose of unique identification if the processing is necessary for authentication and security purposes * Article 4(3) of Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States.

This should also take into account the different behaviour of traffic participants (walking, cycling, passenger cars, public transport, trucks, emergency and auxiliary services), each with their own characteristics, needs and limitations, where political-administrative priorities regularly require different accents in accommodating one group over another (e.g. more priority for cyclists over passenger cars) and the area also continues to develop and change (think of new residential areas and business premises and/or office locations). Within this playing field of goals, interests and changes, iVRIs are necessary to implement this efficiently in practice.","The basis for deploying iVRIs is a combination of the province's various tasks (in particular: safety, mobility, spatial planning, and financial tasks).",1.0,,algoritmeregister@brabant.nl,nld,,"The data used by the algorithm is the real-time data measured by the control system itself using, among other things, detection loops and push buttons, as well as data retrieved via nationwide UDAP.

At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8.

It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists.The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised.

Anonymisation software,Municipality of Tubbergen,"The algorithm underlines personal data in documents. An employee has to look at all pages and check whether the document is properly anonymised. Then the software removes all highlighted information and blacklists it. After that, the documents can be published, for example under the Open Government Act.",Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The anonymisation software is used to anonymise documents published by the municipality faster and better. This way, we prevent data leaks and contribute to better protection of data subjects' AVG rights.","The municipality increasingly has to disclose information. Therefore, privacy- or business-sensitive information has to be lacquered out. Before the algorithm was deployed, this deleting did not always go well. There were data breaches where not all personal data was deleted or where deleted information could still be read. The advantage of anonymisation software is that anonymisation is faster and better. The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server. The content is not stored on this server, so the privacy risk of using the algorithm does not outweigh the privacy benefit of reducing the number of data breaches due to improper anonymisation. ",1.

At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The probability score is used along with vendor-developed proprietary ai models to make the recognition of personal data as accurate as possible. The models are trained using, among others, the following trained datasets as CoNLL-2003, UD Dutch LassySmall v2.8, Dutch NER Annotations for UD LassySmall and UD Dutch Alpino v2.8. Minimum key figures for the accuracy of identifying personal data are as follows: Named entities (precision): 0.78, Named entities (recall): 0.76, Named entities (F-score): 0.77.Finally, a staff member checks the document and when it completes the document, the data to be anonymised is permanently removed from the text layer and a black bar is placed.",The outcome of the algorithm is checked by an employee.

Secure mailing,Municipality of Doesburg,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely. Application is integrated into Outlook's mail environment.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to send it securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging. This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.","From the BIO guidelines for the Government, secure mail is considered an advised measure when personal data or other sensitive information is sent via mail with some regularity.",1.0,,andre.volman@doesburg.nl,nld,,The application works by automatically recognising text elements that may refer to sensitive information that should be sent securely. It also allows a user to specify whether an e-mail should be sent securely or not.,"When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can always choose to send an e-mail explicitly secure or insecure by themselves.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the vendor. If it is found that the algorithm is making incorrect classifications more frequently, this is picked up by the monitoring so that adjustments to the algorithm can be made.

",Health and Healthcare,,In use,"The algorithm was developed because the Hague municipality wants to be better prepared for the future. If the municipality knows how many young people are expected to use Youth Care without Residence in the next six years and the costs involved, it can better anticipate this demand and continue to provide support to all young people who need it in the future.The Youth Prediction Model is used in addition to staff knowledge and skills.

The insights from the prediction model can only be used through human intervention and with the context knowledge and experience of staff involved. If it is decided that the model is no longer usable, this decision will be taken by the model owner (portfolio director of Youth Care) and those directly involved will be informed.","The risks of the algorithm were identified in advance and during the construction of the prediction model. Because the prediction model does not make statements about individuals but about the use of facilities in neighbourhoods, there was no risk that the results from the model could violate the privacy of specific individuals. Furthermore, we only worked with neighbourhoods that were sufficiently large (more than 100 inhabitants) and where a sufficient number of people were using Youth Services (more than 70 users). One reason is that this does not allow for disclosure. That is, by combining characteristics, we cannot identify who the potential users of Youth Aid services are. Furthermore, when building the model, we weighed up together with the privacy officer and the ethical officer which variables could and could not be included from a privacy perspective. Here, the AVG was always the starting point.

Filtering on signal ability enforcement income support,Municipality of Groningen,"Some residents receive income support, such as welfare benefits. You are then only allowed to have a maximum amount of money or equity. It is the municipality's job to check this. Therefore, the municipality gets information about the assets of this group. The municipality uses filtering to decide who to investigate further.",Social Security,,In use,"The purpose of the algorithm is to support the enforcement of the Participation Act and, as much as possible, prevent residents from being unduly checked. Manually checking everyone is neither possible nor desirable, as checks have a very high impact on residents. The filter helps look for explanations of excessive assets. So the impact on citizens is both high and low: it prevents unnecessary checks. These checks have a lot of impact. So the municipality wants to minimise them unnecessarily, but continue to enforce them. ","The advantage of using the filters is that only those people are investigated where excessive equity cannot be explained in any other reasonable way. This saves a lot of time for the enforcement department. In addition, it means that not all files of residents with income support need to be looked at and a large group of residents do not have to provide evidence for their increased and high equity.The downside is that someone may still not be investigated who should be investigated anyway. The municipality accepts that. ","The Participation Act regulates that the municipality is responsible for income support (assistance) when there is no own income or this income is not sufficient. However, conditions are attached to this. The Act also stipulates that it is the municipality's duty to enforce that a benefit is rightly provided. For this case, sections 8c, 53a and 54 are particularly important. One of the conditions is that you should not have too much of your own (increased) assets. ",1.0,,opendata@groningen.nl ,nld,,"Active benefits from previous year, legal ceiling assets, administrator, assets. The amount of assets the municipality receives through the Intelligence Bureau, which receives these data from the Tax Office. ","Every year, the municipality receives hundreds of signals about assets from residents receiving income support. It is not possible to check all these signals manually. Therefore, filtering or selection is used. The filtering is not done automatically. However, the filters used are very easy to translate into rules for an algorithm (if... then...).The municipality sends a list of citizen service numbers (BSNs) of residents receiving benefit support to the Inlichtingenbureau Foundation. The Inlichtingenbureau retrieves information from the Tax Office about assets based on the BSNs provided by the municipality. It then automatically checks which BSN has assets higher than legally permitted. These are signals. These are collected in an Excel list with the amount of assets of a resident receiving income support linked to the docket numbers, as residents are displayed in the benefit system. The list returned to the municipality no longer contains BSNs, nor names or address details.The municipality then applies filtering to this. Some examples of filters used are that people under administration are excluded, as administrators already have to report major financial changes. It also takes into account, for example, the energy allowance paid in 2022 and what can reasonably be saved on social assistance benefit.","After filtering, file research is used to check whether a resident with excessive assets has already reported this himself. If no explanation can be found for excessive assets, the resident in question is asked to provide information and cooperate in the investigation. This is done through a special (enforcement) investigation into entitlement to benefits under the Participation Act. A letter is sent to residents asking how the increase in the balance occurred. Evidence for this can be, for example, compensation or inheritance. If there is no response to this, they are then asked for bank details for the past year. A resident is always invited for an interview before anything changes to the benefit. ","Each investigation follows the four-eye principle, which means that two officials are always involved. In addition, quality officers from the municipality randomly check closed files.Residents who do end up receiving less or no benefits as a result of this process can always appeal this decision.This work process was also submitted to the municipality's Data and Technology Ethics Committee in November 2023, which advised on it. This opinion can be read back on the website of the Groningen municipality's ethics committee.The deployment of this filtering will be further investigated and evaluated.

The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server.

This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer.

There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm.The last risk that remains is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk.

Automated face comparison,Municipality of Gooise Meren,Automated face comparison,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"Automated face comparison serves two purposes: 1. Establishing the identity of the identity card applicant to prevent identity fraud; and 2. Keeping the information in the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) reliable.   A desk clerk does the checking. If the application using the algorithm indicates that the person whose face has been compared is not the person standing at the counter, the counter employee engages a colleague (as a second line) to verify this finding.   These staff apply the 'four-eye principle' when in doubt about the face comparison finding. If they conclude, partly on the basis of their own assessment and observation, that the finding of the face comparator is correct and the identity of the applicant does not match the identity in the photograph, the application for a first registration/resettlement in the BRP or naturalisation will not be processed. This may indicate whether fraud is suspected. If fraud is suspected, 112 is called and the police are called in for further investigation. In this context, the Civil Affairs Department acts in accordance with the model working instruction on identity fraud issued by the WTI (Working Group on Countering Identity Fraud). ",The deployment of this algorithm helps employees of the civil affairs department determine the identity of the resident at the counter.

Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk.

Assigning a risk category by the selection model aims to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare providers and work more on the basis of trust rather than mistrust. Reducing the administrative burden on healthcare providers requires assigning them to risk categories. Reducing the administrative burden is difficult to achieve any other way.

","
The algorithm used in targeted selection is a type of ""decision tree classifier"". It can be seen as a structured method of indicating which applications are likely to be at higher risk of not meeting the legal requirements for re-registration. Each node in this tree represents a specific question about the application, for example the total number of hours worked in the past five years. Based on the answers to these questions, the tree guides the decision across several branches until finally a conclusion is reached: either ""select"" or ""do not select"". In training, the algorithm learns to ask the most informative questions at each step based on the available data in order to divide the applications into smaller and more homogeneous groups.
 
The algorithm offers a choice of 16 different trees. Four different levels in terms of tree depth can be selected (3, 4, 5 or 6) and then the minimum size of the group is determined (100, 200, 300 or 400). Depth refers to the maximum number of splitting or decision steps the tree can have between the root (the start point) and the leaves (the end point). The minimum size of a group refers to the minimum number of applications for BIG re-registration that must be present on an end leaf of the decision tree.
The algorithm calculates the probability that an application belongs to a certain category, allowing us to classify applications as ""medium risk"" or ""high risk"". Only ""high risk"" applications are selected for verification in the targeted sample. This choice was made to ease the administrative burden on healthcare providers as much as possible ('low or medium risk' applications can still fall into the random sample).","
The selection model determines whether an application is selected for having to provide (objectively verifiable) documentary evidence.
The use of the algorithm does not lead to fully automated decision-making. After all, the final substantive assessment of an application based on the evidence provided is done by an employee.","

Preventing direct discrimination - when the files are assessed by the algorithm, no sensitive file characteristics (such as gender, age or having a foreign nationality) are shared on which the algorithm could make a direct distinction. Because these are not included as file characteristics, the algorithm cannot select on them either. Moreover, these characteristics are also not included as relevant criteria in the decision trees. This is to prevent direct discrimination on these characteristics; 
Preventing indirect discrimination - although the decision tree cannot select directly on sensitive file characteristics, it is theoretically possible that a certain - seemingly innocent - characteristic is included in the tree, which has the practical effect that certain groups of healthcare providers are more likely to receive a high risk score. This is prohibited when there is no justification for doing so. During the development of the algorithm, this was considered and it was decided to show 'bias graphs' on the dashboard for the generated decision trees and the current decision tree, showing whether, as a result of a decision tree, certain groups of healthcare providers are selected relatively more often than other groups of healthcare providers. This is made transparent for the following characteristics: age, gender and having or not having a foreign nationality. Based on these bias graphs, a tree with the lowest possible bias or a tree where the indirect bias is objectively justifiable can be chosen;
In addition, the algorithm should be prevented from becoming self-validating. Therefore, in addition to the purposive sample, a random sample also takes place. The subsequent decisions are used to generate new decision trees;
It is not clear to the staff assessing the supporting documents whether the relevant application fell into the random or targeted selection. This is to prevent them from being unknowingly influenced by this information;
Regarding explainability, the following is noted: the decision trees clearly show the different threshold values. These threshold values are clear, concrete and also explainable in application to a concrete case;
Finally, it is noted that a DPIA has been prepared; it has been submitted to the FG for advice and subsequently approved.

This way, we prevent data leaks and contribute to better protection of data subjects' AVG rights.","The municipality increasingly has to disclose information. Therefore, privacy- or business-sensitive information has to be lacquered out. Before the algorithm was deployed, this deleting did not always go well. There were data leaks where not all personal data was deleted or where deleted information could still be read. The advantage of anonymisation software is that anonymisation is faster and better. The disadvantage is that the text layer of the document is analysed by a Microsoft Azure server. The content is not stored on this server, so the privacy risk of using the algorithm does not outweigh the privacy benefit of reducing the number of data breaches due to improper anonymisation.

This may include ordinary personal data, special personal data and criminal data. It may also include business-sensitive information.","Documents are uploaded to the application by an employee. At that point, a copy is made of the original in the form of a PDF with text layer and the metadata of the original document is removed from the copy. This copy ends up on a Dutch server and remains there for a maximum of 30 days. The text layer of the PDF is offered to the machine learning algorithm through an API. This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer. The likelihood score is used together with proprietary ai models developed by the vendor to make personal data recognition as accurate as possible. ",The outcome of the algorithm is checked by an employee. The clerk is required by the software to check all pages. The clerk determines whether the document is correctly anonymised.,"There is no risk of automated decision-making and the algorithm has no impact on fundamental rights because the algorithm does not make decisions with legal consequences. It only suggests anonymising personal data. The algorithm is also used by the developer himself, so errors are quickly found. In addition, the algorithm is trained periodically. At the request of our organisation, our documents are not used to train the algorithm. If the algorithm does not work well enough, we can make adjustments with black- and whitelists.The municipality's employee always does the final check whether a document is correctly anonymised. There is a risk that employees do not check properly; we mitigate this by paying attention to the importance of carefully checking the personal data found by the algorithm.The last risk that remains is the privacy risk of using Azure. Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default. Text sent by the API in synchronous or asynchronous calls to the Azure service may be temporarily stored by Azure for debugging. But the vendor has disabled this option. This limits the risk. Immediately after being processed by Azure, the data and data processing is deleted. Furthermore, the supplier is ISO 27001 certified.

This is a Natural Language Processing algorithm (named entity recognition) from Microsoft Azure. The API returns at which location in the analysed texts a personal data is likely to occur, along with the probability score (a percentage). At that point, Azure immediately removes the text layer.

Because Microsoft may be required to hand over data it processes to US authorities because of the Patriot Act. To mitigate these risks, the vendor has applied privacy by default.

Risk model sales decline NOW,Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment,"The risk model (the algorithm) helps choose which NOW applications to investigate further. It gives clues as to whether the information given in the NOW application is correct. With these indications from the risk model, SZW reviews the application.",Work,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm (the risk model) is to support the Ministry of SZW in choosing which NOW applications should be further investigated for the accuracy of the declared turnover loss.  The risk model compares information provided by the applicant in the NOW application with information from public sources and with information from other government organisations. A very large number of NOW applications have been submitted. By using the risk model, choices can be made faster. As a result, employers receive a decision as soon as possible.The impact for the vast majority of applicants is that they quickly receive a decision on their NOW application without the need for further investigation. For those applicants who do get selected, this means that partly with the help of the risk model, the stated loss of turnover will be investigated further. If a NOW application is investigated then it takes longer to make a decision than if a NOW application is not investigated.  Ultimately, the investigation may reveal a different turnover loss percentage than the applicant submitted in the NOW application. As a result, the final grant amount may differ from the grant amount the applicant expected based on the NOW application."," Advantages:  Scale; Almost half a million applications have been submitted, spread over eight different rounds. If the ministry were to check all these NOW applications, it takes a lot of time and a lot of money. By selecting NOW applications for scrutiny using the risk model, we keep costs as low as possible for everyone: for employers, but also for the government.    Efficient working method; With the deployment of the algorithm (risk model), the working method is efficiently designed. The risk model helps staff make effective and accurate choices based on objective information. As a result, the vast majority of applicants quickly receive a decision without the need for further investigation. In this way, large numbers of applications can be quickly fed back to UWV.  Standardised working method; the Ministry of SZW uses information from other public sources for the risk model. This is information from, for example, the Chamber of Commerce on the start of the business and who owns it. This objective information is used in the risk model. With this, the risk model helps staff make choices based on objective information and comparisons.  DisadvantagesThe risk model gives an indication of whether the stated turnover loss from a NOW application is correct. This indication is based on information from public sources and information from other government organisations. The model cannot take into account every unique situation that may apply to an employer. As a result, it does not always accurately reflect reality.

Based on these address searches, incorrect address data is corrected so that public bodies can perform their public duties based on accurate information.Using the algorithm, you can prioritise addresses where there is a greater than 50 per cent chance that something is wrong in the registration and at the same time ensure that you do not visit citizens' doors unnecessarily. There is no automatic decision-making in this algorithm. There is always human intervention by the municipal official and the LAA partnership, which consists of signal providers, RvIG, the VNG and the NVVB.If an enquiry into registration of persons at the address is going to take place, a home visit to the address is carried out which may involve personal privacy.Based on its own address investigation, the municipality decides whether the address data in the BRP should be updated. A decision by the municipality can be appealed.The profile does not use (personal) data that could lead to discrimination and does not select on nationality, place of birth or derivatives thereof.","The accuracy of (address) data in the BRP is essential for the functioning of the Dutch government. A government that does not know or does not know how to find its citizens is unable to perform the tasks entrusted to it by its citizens. In many cases, it is a precondition for the correct implementation of legal regulations and for the effectiveness of government policies. For citizens, proper registration is important for their correspondence with the government and for claiming address-related government services.The algorithm ensures efficient and most effective finding of addresses where there is a high probability of incorrect address registrations. Using the algorithm, you can prioritise addresses where the probability of incorrect registration is greater than 50 per cent while ensuring that you do not unnecessarily visit citizens' doors. If an address meets the algorithm's selection criteria, the address is shared with a municipality. Following the signal, the municipality may decide to launch an address investigation. This may include a home visit by the municipality. Selection of a high-risk address does not automatically lead to an adjustment of the address data in the BRP.

The personal data in the BRP are partially pseudonymised along with the BAG identification code. The decision tree consists of a number of filters that are applied. In the first step, all addresses that have ""cell function"" according to the BAG are removed. Next, it is determined how many square metres of living space per registered person are present at the address. Addresses where the living area per person is lower than the defined criterion are selected. A number of addresses are then excluded from this selection: addresses where only house families (persons with a first-degree relationship registered in the BRP) are registered; addresses where the number of persons registered at the address falls below the minimum criterion; addresses that, according to the BAG, have less than 1 square metre of living space; addresses that, according to the BAG, are not in use; addresses that, according to the BAG, have both the use function 'Health function' and 'Accommodation function'.The addresses remaining after this filtering are pseudonymised and delivered to the Information Exchange (IKP). In the IKP, addresses delivered to municipalities in the previous 365 days are removed. The IKP then checks, based on up-to-date information from the BRP and BAG, whether the addresses still meet the profile's selection criteria. The remaining addresses are further refined based on calculation rules developed from practical experience and past results. Addresses with a relatively low probability of incorrect registration are removed. Addresses with a relatively high probability of incorrect registration are delivered to the municipality. The municipality decides independently for each delivered address whether an address search is necessary or not. The municipality shares the results of its LAA work with the IKP.

Selection aid WBU table,Province of South Holland,"The WBU table indicates within which time windows, which traffic restriction measures may be taken by contractors, for maintenance on Provincial roads.

Tevens is het (nog) niet de bedoeling dat deze URL door externe wordt gebruikt. In eerste instantie wordt de WBU doorvertaald in een tabel (zoals nu ook het geval is).,In development,"Using historical data, this algorithm allows you to see what type of closure and traffic measure can be applied to a road. You can also see which times are suitable. The WBU table selection tool is used in part to create the WBU table. It contributes to reducing operational costs and increasing traffic safety. -Increasing road safety The CROW96b provides calculation methods to determine at which traffic intensity at which traffic measure may be applied. The current WBU table does not take this into account. Because a web application displays the WBU per type of traffic measure, the requirements from the guideline are always met. This keeps traffic safety guaranteed. -Operational costs Unlike the old WBU table, the web application makes it possible to calculate the WBU per day. Experience shows that the traffic pattern on a Wednesday and Friday is significantly quieter than on a Tuesday or Thursday. The case study below shows the financial implications of this. Our DBO contractor has scheduled mowing works throughout December in the Hoeksche-Waard. The work will be carried out in accordance with a half lane closure (Fig 1323b). The old WBU table indicates that the WBU is between 09:00 and 15:00. The web application to be created indicates that on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, work can be done from 09:00 to 16:00. This implies that the contractor can work an extra 3 hours per week. This is therefore 12 hours extra per month. By having an extra 12 hours of working time, the contractor will not have to hit the road as often. Assuming that the work is carried out through a pre-warning truck, action truck and end truck, this saves the rental and operational costs of three work vehicles and three drivers. This can save money. This is just an example of one contractor at work. Around 2,400 TVM applications are submitted every year. By applying the WBU application, a large proportion of these applications can probably be processed more efficiently and save costs. It is plausible, that thanks to the WBU web application, traffic congestion is reduced. This will also save social costs in the form of fewer vehicle loss hours.","With the algorithm, there is less disruption for road users. In addition, road safety is increased because the CROW96B guideline is met. There is less congestion and fewer vehicle loss hours.",The algorithm gives an advice/prediction.

Performance monitor,Inspectorate of Education,"This algorithm creates a risk sorting of educational institutions (schools, courses or school boards) to conduct targeted desk research, as part of the annual performance and risk analysis. ",Education and Science,https://www.onderwijsinspectie.nl/onderwerpen/werkwijze-van-de-inspectie/jaarlijkse-prestatieanalyse,In use,"The Education Inspectorate supervises the quality of education (the 'guarantee function'). From the safeguarding function of supervision, the inspectorate ensures compliance with the Education Act (and the regulations based on it). This is about what the board and the school/college all have to do. Because of this safeguarding function, every year we map out whether there are educational institutions with risks. Because there are very many schools, study programmes and boards in the Netherlands, we do this check partly automatically. To do this, we use an algorithm: the algorithm calculates a risk score for each educational institution.Based on the risk sorting made by the algorithm, manual desk analyses are performed. For the desk analysis, analysts and/or inspectors look at the data used for the algorithm, but also at other things, such as a school guide, for example, or specific reports (e.g. a concerned parent who contacted the inspectorate). If, based on the manual analysis, inspectors think the risks are high and serious, the school or board will be contacted. Inspectors may then also conduct an on-site investigation at the school, programme, or board.","The advantage of using an algorithm that calculates risk is that not all institutions need to be examined manually every year. Manual analysis costs a lot of time and money. By examining the institutions with a high risk score manually, analysts and inspectors can be deployed where they are needed most. A disadvantage could be that the algorithm would only show schools at risk in subjects the inspectorate has data on. To prevent the inspectorate from only looking at data, analysts and inspectors always have the option of performing additional desk analyses. For example, for educational institutions they do have concerns about, even if that institution does not have a high risk score.","Education Supervision Act (WOT), Public Access Act (WOB), Secondary Education Act (WVO), Primary Education Act (WPO), Expertise Centres Act (WEC), Education and Vocational Education Act (WEB), Higher Education and Scientific Research Act (WHW) and General Administrative Law Act (AWB)",1.0,,https://contactformulier.onderwijsinspectie.nl/contact,nld,,"The main sources of information are pupil numbers, staff characteristics, financial characteristics of the institutions, learning outcomes and signals (from parents and pupils who contact us). Information on institutions comes from files from the Register of Educational Participants (ROD, formerly BRON), files from CBS, files from DUO, data supplied by schools (e.g. the Social Safety Monitor data) and data from Inspectorate of Education's own registries. Data are always aggregated to school, board or institution level.","It involves a rule-based algorithm. The rules are established with the help of inspectors and analysts, and based on quantitative research. The various data are aggregated to the school/board/institution level and thus the various indicators are calculated. A risk score is then calculated based on the combination of indicator scores from 1-3 years, the limits for what is considered risky, the annual weights and the weightings per indicator. The output of the model is a risk score per school/board/institution.","The outcome of the algorithm is a risk score. Educational institutions with a high risk score receive a manual desk analysis. In addition, inspectors or analysts can also conduct manual desk analyses for institutions they have concerns about even if that institution has a low risk score. If the desk analysis shows that the risks are high and serious, the institution is contacted and other supervisory activities may follow. Sometimes this means an on-site inspection visit. The desk analysis and any on-site investigation are carried out entirely by people.","Perfect risk estimation is impossible. To keep the risk estimation as good as possible, annual assessments of the quality of risk estimation of the Performance Monitor are carried out. To this end, we examine whether the schools, programmes and institutions with high risk scores are indeed more likely on average to receive an unsatisfactory assessment in the following year. If it turns out that the predictive power is low, we try to make adjustments that ensure better predictive power. Indeed, if it turns out that the risk assessment has insufficient predictive power, then certain institutions may be examined unnecessarily. The time of analysts and inspectors is then not used in the right places (inefficient). Institutions that do have problems may then be left out of the picture.Even more specifically: if certain groups of schools are disproportionately (disproportionately to the actual risks) represented in the high-risk groups, these institutions may be unnecessarily burdened. Even then, there is inefficient use of capacity, and unfair burden on certain schools or boards. Because institutions with higher risk scores are investigated more often, wrong risk estimation can also continue (tunnel vision). Therefore, since September 2023, we have started on-site examinations at randomly selected educational institutions. This allows us to evaluate the quality of risk estimation even better.

Using search terms, a list of documents and asylum applications that have similarities with the search terms appears. The employee chooses from the list and opens the document and/or application to go through the information. The clerk can choose to copy, for example, the legal grounds on which an application has been approved or rejected in the past.

","The algorithm determines the relevance of documents and asylum applications eligible to be searched and found through that finding system. The relevance is determined in 2 steps:1. The employee can filter in the main screen by, for example, year and nationality (which is a highly relevant variable in an asylum application) and can search by terms. These search terms are then searched in the filtered documents and the documents where they occur (whether in combination or not) come up in a list. This list of documents is ordered by relevance; the higher, the more (possibly) relevant these documents are. This relevance score is determined by standard search algorithms. A document is ranked higher if terms occur more often and also in combination with each other. The employee can then check the documents themselves to see if they are relevant to the case to be handled.2. The employee can also choose to have the found documents aggregated (merged) at case level. The documents that were filtered and in which the search terms came up are now listed per asylum application and presented in a table. Now the employee does not see a list of documents but a list of asylum applications, and again, the higher the asylum application is in the list, the more relevant it may be. In this case, relevance is determined by a scoring mechanism based on document type.With the help of experts, it has been determined that some documents are more important than others. Consider an asylum narrative (which describes the story of the asylum seeker) or a document summarising the asylum application. In the overview of asylum applications, the employee can quickly see in which documents the search terms occurred.","The caseworker searches for words and gets a list of all documents and asylum applications that contain these words. The caseworker reviews the list and assesses whether it contains relevant information to process the application. Due to changes in policy, a previous decision on an asylum application may no longer fit the current policy. The caseworker is obliged to decide based on the policy currently in force. Incidentally, each new asylum application is always read and assessed by several experts.","Only employees with permission have access to this algorithm. Employees must also undergo training before they can use this algorithm; this is part of the internal IND training. This training explains how the employee can and may use this search and find function. For example, the employee is not allowed to search on persons (names). The IND is bound by privacy rules under the AVG. This means that documents and applications may not be viewed just like that. The employee himself is always the expert and the decision-maker (and not the algorithm). The employee may not judge solely on the results of the algorithm, but must always take into account the current policy, applicable instructions and current events.With experts, which documents are relevant in an asylum application are assessed in advance.

Dynamic boating traffic modelCrowds per rak: 
This algorithm calculates the number of vessels passing each rak per hour. A rak is a stretch of waterway between, for example, two bridges or a bridge and a lock. The purpose of this algorithm is to understand traffic flows and how they change over time. Gathering this information helps inform, and evaluate, policies and make decisions about traffic measures.
Traffic volumes are determined from two data sources: location data from vessels with an AIS transponder (mainly commercial shipping) and passages of vessels with an electronic vignette. Electronic vignettes are mandatory for motorised pleasure and commercial vessels. The passage of vessels with vignette can be measured as vessels pass a short distance from a sensor.  By measuring the shortest route of each vessel, the model derives itineraries of vessels. This pseudominated data is translated into the number of passages per hour per rack. Developed in 2020, the ""crowds per rak"" report provides up-to-date traffic volumes via the Digital Canal dashboard. The historically aggregated data are also used for analysis.

","
The Digital Canal:
The Digital Canal measures traffic on Amsterdam's inland waterways. The project started in 2019 under the Sailing programme. The Sailing programme falls within the Space and Economy cluster. For the project, sensors have been placed along the inland waterways in the city centre and the main waterways outside the centre of Amsterdam. By deploying these sensors, the municipality is developing a dynamic traffic model and tools for information-driven enforcement. This is done with the help of algorithms. The calculated traffic data is processed and presented in a digital overview (dashboard). The dashboard is accessible to policy advisers, nautical managers and waterway inspectors.
Within the Digital Canal, six algorithms are used: two for traffic monitoring (Pressure per lane and waterway traffic model) and four for information-driven enforcement (Detection of illegal passenger shipping, Reporting speeding passenger shipping, Detection of noise nuisance on the water and Reporting mooring use passenger shipping). Now the Pressure per rack algorithm is described.

It allows a substantiated recommendation to be made for an intervention to prevent recidivism and encourage positive development of the young person.,Law,,In use,"The RvdK provides criminal advice to the public prosecutor and the juvenile court for young people aged 12 to 18. The RvdK uses the Landelijk Instrumentarium Jeugdstrafrechtketen (LIJ), of which the Ritax is a part, in its investigation to provide the most appropriate punishment advice for the young person. The RvdK investigator talks to the young person, parents and often school. With this information, a questionnaire is completed. The RvdK produces a report containing the results of the Ritax and the advice. This report is given to the young person, the parents, the juvenile court and the public prosecutor.","Research shows that an estimate based on the results of a scientific instrument is better than the estimate based solely on the experience of the researcher. The calculation model behind the recidivism rates is based on scientific research on factors influencing juvenile recidivism. The outcome of the Ritax, together with the researcher's opinion, leads to the sentencing recommendation.","The basis for the RvdK's use of Ritax lies in their statutory duties. The duties that apply when using Ritax are set out in the Criminal Code (Sr) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Sv). The advisory task in the event of a behaviour-influencing measure is described in article 77w, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, the advisory task in the event of detention and early assistance is described in article 490 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the advisory task in criminal cases of juveniles is described in articles 494/494a/498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

We try to help people at risk of poverty as early as possible to prevent them from getting into serious debt or being evicted. When problems are still small, advice or a light intervention can be enough. To do that, we need to know who is at risk of getting into debt. That is why we get a notification from health insurers, housing associations, energy suppliers, water companies and some public authorities, among others, if they have a customer who is in arrears with them.  That the creditor may pass this data to the municipality, including personal data, is stated in the Municipal Debt Assistance Act. After the notification, the municipality supplements the data with information known to us about the reported person. This is information that is needed to determine whether or not someone is a benefit recipient, a client of WPI (the Werk, Participatie en Inkomen department of the municipality of Amsterdam) and to determine the best care provider to forward the notification to. Supplementing the notification with the information known to the municipality is done automatically, at the press of a button. Someone is always needed to trigger a check for data. The system forwards the notification to a counsellor at the municipality. He or she tries to get in touch with the citizen within 14 days and makes an initial analysis within 28 days.

The information is needed not only to link the right social worker to the notification, but also for the social worker to start the conversation with the customer together with the right customer manager: ","Architecture of the modelThe creditor makes a notification in the registration and information system 'RIS Matching'. Once every fortnight, a municipality employee links all new reports (at the push of a button) to data on the reported person from the Poverty Reduction Department's data warehouse and to data on the various debt assistance programmes available. That link allows the municipality to determine whether it is dealing with the right citizen and which social worker is best placed to contact the citizen. It then checks whether there are multiple debt arrears within one household. Up to this point, the process is automated. Next, there are a few options:For a single payment arrears of less than 250 euros, a text message, letter or e-mail is automatically sent from RIS Matching (depending on which contact details are available).","The system makes a number of choices independently (automated), for example to send a text message, email or letter in case of arrears lower than 250 euros, or to which postcode area the notification should be forwarded. During the data linking process, there is one moment of human supervision: the linking of the creditors' notification with the data of the Poverty Reduction Department is automated, but human action is required to start the linking. From the moment the notification is forwarded to the social workers in the appropriate district, the process is no longer automated. The social service provider visits the reported citizen if the citizen does not contact them himself.","The registration and information system called 'RIS Matching' is provided by the company Inforing, a company that supplies this system to 200 municipalities. They regularly conduct so-called 'pen and hack tests' to check that the system cannot be hacked by third parties. They also ensure that personal data is securely managed and not sold to third parties. Security also lies with Inforing. The security meets the BIO standard.

Licence plate recognition for enforcement of loading and unloading times,Municipality of Groningen,"To keep Groningen's city centre attractive and easily accessible, traffic by trucks and vans is being restricted.

That is why traffic by trucks and delivery vans is being restricted. These will only be allowed in the city centre within certain times (window times). A zero-emission zone will also be introduced from 2025. This means that a delivery van or lorry can only enter this zone if it does not emit any harmful substances, such as a car running on electricity or hydrogen. Control of this is done by the municipality with cameras that can read license plates. The purpose of the algorithm is to enable efficient enforcement.  The algorithm only impacts vehicles that should not be in the areas. Only the offending vehicle is captured. Non-violators are disregarded (and thus not put on image). ","The advantage of the algorithm is that it is more efficient, faster and cheaper. Instead of employees having to continuously read images, now only a picture is taken of a vehicle that should not be in the area. Merely placing traffic signs is not enough. Physical closure with traffic poles (pollers)also has disadvantages, such as the high purchase and operating costs and the damage that occurs. Moreover, the area must always remain accessible to emergency services. Camera surveillance is more efficient and effective than the alternatives.  ","The legal basis for the deployment of this algorithm is the 1994 Road Traffic Act. The Road Traffic Act 1994 (WVW) forms the basis for the regulation of road traffic in the Netherlands.

Public space notification,Municipality of Oldambt,"Residents can report through an online reporting system if something needs to be fixed or cleaned up in the public space (e.g. street or park). If the municipality is responsible for this, it will be dealt with. ","Traffic, Space and Infrastructure, Public Order and Safety",,In use,"Previously, reporters themselves had to choose to which main and subcategory their report best fitted, so that the report went to the right department of the municipality. Thanks to the algorithm, this is no longer necessary; the (sub)category is determined on the basis of the report text and the report is automatically classified. This saves the notifier (the resident) work and the employee too, since (usually) without any intermediate steps the notification goes straight to the team that has to deal with it. ",The reason for using the algorithm is the efficiency gains it makes.  ,,1.0,,info@gemeente-oldambt.nl,nld,,"Notification texts are used for the algorithm. While making a report, the reporter can choose to leave a phone number or e-mail address on a new page, but this information is only used for providing feedback on status changes. This information is not kept longer than necessary for this purpose, nor is it used for the algorithm.","The text of the notification is broken down into individual words. Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight. From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to.","Notifications do not always end up in the right category and the algorithm also does not always recognise which category the notification should go in (and then puts it in the Other category). In those cases, the notification still has to be put in the right category manually.","There are few risks in this algorithm. Small risk is that the algorithm puts a report in the wrong category. In that case, a reporter may get follow-up questions that have nothing to do with the report made.

In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging. This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,1.0,,info@gemeente-oldambt.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the supplier.

Zivver,Municipality of Waalwijk,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging. This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. The classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mai",,1.0,,info@waalwijk.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","n principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the supplier. If it appears that the algorithm is making incorrect classifications more often, this is picked up by the monitoring, so that adjustments can be made to the algorithm. For the using organisation, the accuracy of Smart Classification is also visible in an administrator dashboard.",Zivver,,"Zivver, e-mail",,2021-02,,,Other algorithms,,,,12254864

TenderTrends,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,"TenderTrends is a model that searches for relevant tenders based on entered keywords and filters and displays data from these. For instance, if the words 'grass', 'mowing' and 'trees' are entered, tenders containing one or more of these words will appear. The user can convert a selection of tenders into charts. ",Organisation and business operations,tenderned.nl,In development,"The purpose of this algorithm is to support contracting authorities in their tender preparation process. It does this by providing insights into similar tenders.This goal is achieved in a number of steps:The contracting authority prepares the tender by formulating the needs, requirements, characteristics and other issues. Next, the contracting authority can consult TenderTrends by entering keywords and specifying additional criteria (e.g. type of contracting authority: 'municipality').The user receives a list of potentially relevant tenders based on his search query.From this list, the user selects the most relevant tenders in his situation. This will return a summary of historical key figures (average number of questions from market players, average turnaround time, most frequently selected procedures, etc.) and public contact data belonging to these selected tenders.Users can apply this data to their own tenders to make more appropriate choices in advance. The user can also contact colleagues to gain experiences.The impact of TenderTrends is mainly noticeable in applying public funds more efficiently and offering more insights to contracting authorities. Furthermore, TenderTrends possibly supports in more diverse procurement by showing alternative procedures of similar tenders. No negative impact has been noted to TenderTrends because:its use is optional;no confidential information (personal or company data) is shown;the contracting authority always makes the decisions itself.Furthermore, tenders can be drafted more clearly for entrepreneurs from the beginning. This contributes to the ease of tendering. A possible example: a new tender was drafted with TenderTrends where the contracting authority noticed that many questions were asked in historical tenders (data from TenderTrends). The contracting authority then investigated this further and resolved some of the common questions in advance by establishing clear communication and requirements. Subsequently, market players no longer need to ask a question about this and can proceed with the tender.There is no direct impact for citizens and businesses.","TenderNed has taken into account the questions: 'what is allowed?', 'what is possible?' and 'what is desirable?'. Legal and ethical questions were also taken into account.From this, points such as privacy, propriety, responsibility emerged. For each of the possible risks, steps were taken to minimise the negative impact. An example is sensitive procurement information. Here, it was decided to use only publicly accessible tenders.Another measure is Human in the loop (HITL), or the human who sits at the knobs of the model and ultimately chooses which data is relevant for the summary. The model is unsupervised, meaning the model is trained without knowing what is right or wrong. The model looks purely at how many words match and which ones are most informative. This means that the word 'grass' is more informative than 'tender' because the word 'tender' appears in almost all texts. In the case of TenderTrends, this means that what the model predicts may be statistically correct, but the results will not always be relevant to the user. We periodically perform internal validation by testing a number of searches and manually determining whether they are really relevant. Also, the end user always makes the final decision so that the relevance of the summarised data is ensured. For example, the model can predict that a search about plant maintenance is very similar to embankment maintenance. The end user can then notice this and ignore this 'prediction'.Each of the risks found are resolved or avoided. The risks were also discussed with various domain experts (users, lawyers, etc.).The trade-off that remained after resolving the risks was whether to deploy TenderTrends or continue with the current state of affairs, without TenderTrends. The choice was made to continue because TenderTrends:is optional, the contracting authority is not obliged to use TenderTrends.does not carry a negative impact. It is a non-directive, neutral application that only provides insights.potentially saves public money. Information on comparable tenders can be collected faster.Furthermore, even after conducting the Impact Assessment for Human Rights when deploying Algorithms (IAMA), it was found that there is no negative impact.

The user then has the option to further select the notices relevant to them. This selection is then converted into insights for the user through graphs and tables (e.g. average number of lots).The language model is trained with historical and public data of tenders. The title and description of tenders were pasted together. Then typical Dutch stop words were removed from the text (e.g. de, het, een, zoals, omdat). With the remaining texts, a dictionary was created in which all words were counted. Finally, a number emerges from the model indicating whether a word contains a lot of information (a high number) or little information (a low number). The more often a word is used the lower the number. These numbers are recalculated after a certain amount of time. Calculating these numbers is the self-learning part. ","Within this model, there is human intervention. Briefly, the model works as follows:The user enters search terms himself.The model calculates relevance of all historical tenders in the dataset.The model presents a maximum number of relevant tenders (the user determines the maximum number) including the amount of agreement from 0 (no agreement) to 100 (full agreement).The user sees the title, description, and procurement category of each tender.Based on this information, the user can select the tenders to be analysed about.The application (not the algorithm) produces a number of graphs of the selected tenders based on the key figures present (lead time, price, procedure, number of questions, etc.).Herein, it becomes clear that the TenderTrends application consists of 3 parts in total: the search, the pre-selection by the algorithm, and finally, the human intervention.This split ensures that the user has a lot of control over the analysis and can work with it himself. At the front end (the search), the user defines requirements (mandatory keywords, region of tender, etc.). The model searches more than 50,000 historical tenders and shows the most important results. The user evaluates the results and includes the relevant tenders in the analysis. The path after this analysis lies further with the contracting authority. However, TenderTrends does offer ","The following mitigating measures have been taken within the model:The user makes a selection of the actually relevant tenders prior to the data analysis. This ensures human intervention and checks which data the model bases the analysis on.TenderTrends only displays and uses publicly available data. This prevents sensitive information from being included in the model and thus becoming publicly available.The model uses a 'local dataset' that is free of sensitive information. Thus, the model does not communicate directly with an internal database. With this, there are fewer inter-system dependencies (database must be approachable) and there is no risk of an attack on the database (information security). Other mitigating measures include things like the way data is presented so that it is more accessible to the user. The best example is the output of the model, which is a static score that is difficult to understand for people not at home in the field of language data. The choice was made to rename the score to 'degree of similarity' and display it as a filled bar. The fuller the bar the greater the similarity to the query.

We do this by reducing parking in public spaces by various means. For example, by encouraging alternatives such as P+R, car parks, garages/neighbourhood car parks and on-site parking. In addition, paid parking applies in large parts of the city. The municipality of Groningen monitors this paid parking using scan cars. By deploying this algorithm, the probability of a parking check has increased, but the result remains the same.","By using scan cars, the municipality of Groningen can carry out parking enforcement more simply, efficiently and carefully. A municipal supervisor tests whether the algorithm has been implemented correctly. This reduces the risk of errors, i.e. incorrectly imposed assessments. ","According to sections 149 and 225 of the Municipalities Act and article 2a of the Road Traffic Act 1994, the municipality may adopt an ordinance for fiscal parking enforcement. This is an ordinance that lays down the rules around parking within the municipality. These are redefined annually.

This overview is created by the municipality itself. ","The electric scanning car makes daily rounds of the city to check whether motorists have paid for a parking space. On top of the car are cameras. These cameras automatically scan all license plates of parked cars and use an image recognition algorithm to identify license plates. The license plates are compared with a database containing all registered parking entitlements, both those of permit holders and purchased tickets. A positive result means the car has a valid parking right. In case of a negative result, something is not right and is checked by a supervisor. ","Vehicles that do not have parking rights are forwarded to an enforcer from the municipality of Groningen. The enforcer checks again whether it is true that the car has no parking right. The enforcer checks whether the license plate has been properly scanned and whether there is a special situation. After these checks, the enforcer may or may not impose an additional assessment (parking fine). ","The municipality has chosen not to impose fully digitised after-tax assessments. In case of a negative result (the vehicle does not appear to have parking rights), a municipal supervisor always checks the results of the algorithm. The scanned license plates are only used for checking parking rights and not for other matters. The license plate recognition system complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

A monitoring well is a tube installed in the ground in which the groundwater level can be measured. Monitoring wells tell what the moisture condition of a terrain is, analyses of soil chemistry show how acidic, calcareous or nutrient-rich a soil is. These measurements require a lot of effort, are costly, and are also difficult to scale from measuring point to vegetation surface.The aim of ITERATIO is to achieve better analysis of sites using the available data collected.

The different vegetation types are usually underpinned by a number of recordings.In ITERATIO, each vegetation type has been assigned a value for terrain condition. These values are associated with each patch of the vegetation map and made visible through colours in the abiotic value map.Apart from easily processing the mappings prepared according to the Digital Standard with ITERATIO 2, it also provides for the import of GeoPackage output from the National Database Vegetation and Habitats (NDVH).

Searching whether someone is already registered can prevent people from being registered multiple times. The algorithm to search phonetically can be applied if a person is not found based on fingerprints, or if foreigners do not have an identity document.

","The algorithm can be used to search for data of persons whose details are not well known. This can lead to better identification of foreigners.

Reinforcement scenario consideration for homes not meeting safety standard,National coordinator Groningen,"If homes are not declared at standard, a recommendation for a strengthening scenario is automatically created. The scenario depends on the market value of the current house and the cost of structural strengthening or demolition and new construction.","Living, Public Order and Safety, Space and Infrastructure",https://www.nationaalcoordinatorgroningen.nl/versterken/versterking-in-stappen/fase-4-planvorming/versterkingsmogelijkheden 	,In use,The purpose of the calculation is to outline a scenario for the resident to bring homes that are not at standard to standard. The impact is to be able to give clear advice on the strengthening path to follow.,"The benefits consist of as fair and equal a consideration framework as possible when deciding on a particular reinforcement. NCG is transparent about this.The disadvantages are in the changes in the assessment framework over time due to advancing insight and/or policy changes.Because the advantages largely outweigh the disadvantages, it is reasonable to use this algorithm in NCG's assessment framework. In addition, this approach makes it explainable to property owners, residents and citizens.",The basis for this algorithm is a policy choice made in December 2017 and described in the 'multi-year letter'.,1.0,,iv@nationaalcoordinatorgroningen.nl	,nld,,Building reinforcement investment cost (BKV): the cost of the reinforcement measures and ancillary works required according to the reinforcement advice to bring the building up to standard (read: safe):The rebuilding value: the total cost to demolish the current building and rebuild a functionally equivalent and earthquake-resistant building.The market value: the value of the building on the housing market without the value of the land on which the building stands.,"The scenario consideration aims to generate a scenario for the owner on how to bring a sub-standard building back up to standard, within the financial possibilities offered by the need for strengthening. There are basically two methods of addressing an existing building that is not up to standard:1.    The first method is to reinforce the existing building with structural modifications.2.    The second method is the alternative, which is to demolish the existing building and replace it with a new earthquake-resistant building. The financial equation underlying the scenario concerns the market value (MW) of a property plus the investment cost of structural strengthening (BKV) relative to the rebuilding value (HBW). The MW is constructed by subtracting the land value from the WOZ. After entering the basic data, an automatic ratio calculation is started comparing BKV with the HBW and the MW. Deviations above 20% are automatically forwarded to an expert for recalculation. If it falls directly within the ratio, or after checking with the building expert, the values are used to arrive at the correct reinforcement scenario:- Scenario A Structural strengthening: 110% BKV &lt; 100% HBW and 110% BKV &lt;= 100% MW- Scenario B structural strengthening: 110% B/C &lt; 100% HBW and 110% B/C &gt; 100% MW &lt;= 150% MW- Scenario C Structural strengthening or alternative: 110% B/C &lt; 100% HBW and 110% B/C &gt; 150% MW- Scenario D Structural strengthening or alternative: 110% BTC &gt;= 100% HBW &lt;= 150% HBW- Scenario E Bespoke solution: 110% BTC &gt; 150% HBW Scenario A - If the BKV investment costs are lower than the MW and lower than the HBW, there is no choice. Then structural strengthening according to the strengthening advice is the only option.Scenario B - If the BKV investment costs are higher than the MW but lower than 150% of the MW and lower than the HBW there is no choice. Then structural strengthening according to the strengthening advice is the only option.Scenario C - If the BKV investment cost is higher than 150% of the MW but lower than the rebuilding value, the owner has the choice of either structural strengthening according to the strengthening advice or choosing an alternative. If the alternative of demolition and new construction is chosen, the owner is responsible for contributing the difference between the investment cost of BKV and the HBW to enable new construction. The owner can also choose not to make a (or a lower) own contribution available, but to build back a cheaper building (smaller or with less functionality) with the available budget. The new building to be built must comply with the applicable building regulations and therefore also be earthquake-proof. For additional costs, such as temporary accommodation, owners are expected to contribute proportionally.Scenario D - If the investment cost BKV is higher than 150% of the MW and higher than the HBW, but lower than 150% of the HBW, the owner has the choice to either reinforce construction according to the reinforcement advice or choose an alternative. If the alternative of demolition and new construction is chosen, the NCG is fully responsible for the budget of this alternative and no own contribution is requested from the owner. A functionally similar building will be built within the legal preconditions. The new building to be built must meet the applicable building regulations and thus be earthquake-resistant. Additional costs, such as temporary accommodation, are borne by the NCG.Scenario E - If the investment costs BKV are higher than 150% of the HBW and 150% of the MW, the owner has the choice between an alternative such as demolition and new construction or purchase and demolition or for a tailor-made solution. If an alternative is chosen, the same rules apply as for scenario D. In the case of customisation, the available budget is 150% of the rebuilding value and a modification is sought to make the house earthquake-resistant even though the budget is lower than the calculated investment costs for structural reinforcement. After the scenario determination, a proposal is made by the NCG for the owner. In Scenarios A, B and C, the proposal is to carry out the reinforcement described in the reinforcement advice. In scenarios A and B that proposal is final, in scenario C the owner has the option of demolition and rebuilding. In scenarios D and E, the NCG's proposal is demolition and rebuilding. The owner has the alternative choice of still opting for structural strengthening or using the buy-sell scheme. After a discussion with the owner, the choice is registered in GHG. ","All scenario provisions involve advice that is always discussed by the resident supervisor with the owner/occupier. This does not involve fully automated decision-making.In addition, in doubtful cases, the construction expert always checks the calculation. Investment costs are an estimate of the total cost. The market value is determined on the basis of the WOZ value minus the land value. Experts may differ slightly in this.Technically, the calculation is as follows: (Investment cost / reconstruction value= 0.8 &lt; X &lt; 1.2) OR the ratio: (investment cost / market value = 0.8 &lt; X &lt; 1.2) it is recorded as different and passed on to the cost expert(s).","The risk is reduced, through human intervention by the resident supervisor and owner. In addition, a ratio is built in, as a result, if the ratio is exceeded, an additional cost expert is always consulted.

By catching them in time and offering help, we want to prevent arrears from increasing and developing into a problematic debt situation. It also helps reduce social costs for debt relief and ensures creditors get their money sooner. The impact of the algorithm itself is not that big.
